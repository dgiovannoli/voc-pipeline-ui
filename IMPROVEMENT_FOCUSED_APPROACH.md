## **IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Stage 2 Integration Strategy**
```python
def generate_improvement_focused_themes():
    # 1. Get Stage 2 enriched data with sentiment and business impact
    stage2_data = get_stage2_response_labeling(client_id='Rev')
    
    # 2. Identify high-impact improvement opportunities
    improvement_themes = extract_improvement_themes(
        filter_by_impact='high',
        filter_by_sentiment='negative',
        filter_by_priority='high'
    )
    
    # 3. Identify winning factors for context
    winning_themes = extract_winning_themes(
        filter_by_impact='high',
        filter_by_sentiment='positive',
        filter_by_priority='high'
    )
    
    # 4. Generate balanced assessment
    assessment = generate_balanced_assessment(
        improvements=improvement_themes,
        wins=winning_themes,
        context='paying_customers'
    )
    
    return {
        'improvement_opportunities': improvement_themes,  # Priority 1
        'winning_factors': winning_themes,               # Priority 2
        'balanced_assessment': assessment                # Priority 3
    }
```

### **Expected Output Format**
```
üìà IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Priority 1):
   ‚Ä¢ Technical delays affecting user workflow
