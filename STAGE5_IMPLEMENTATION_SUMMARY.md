2. **Performance Calculation**: Calculate average scores, mentions, and critical ratios
3. **Rating Assignment**: Apply performance rating logic (EXCEPTIONAL to CRITICAL ISSUE)
4. **Priority Determination**: Assign executive priorities based on scores and company impact
5. **Deal Impact Analysis**: Identify criteria affecting won vs lost deals

### Step 2: Executive Theme Synthesis
1. **Theme Selection**: Filter themes by strength (High/Medium)
2. **Criteria Integration**: Link themes to relevant criteria performance
3. **Priority Scoring**: Calculate priority scores using weighted factors
4. **LLM Processing**: Generate executive narratives with criteria context
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validate and rank executive themes

### Step 3: Executive Readiness Assessment
1. **Impact Level**: Determine business impact (High/Medium/Emerging)
2. **Readiness Category**: Assess presentation readiness
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: Generate actionable insights
4. **Competitive Context**: Identify competitive implications

## Performance Rating Logic

### Criteria Performance Ratings
```python
def calculate_performance_rating(avg_score, mentions, critical_mentions):
    critical_ratio = critical_mentions / mentions if mentions > 0 else 0
    
    if avg_score >= 3.5 and critical_ratio >= 0.3:
        return "EXCEPTIONAL"
    elif avg_score >= 3.0 and critical_ratio >= 0.2:
        return "STRONG"
    elif avg_score >= 2.5:
        return "GOOD"
    elif avg_score >= 2.0:
        return "NEEDS ATTENTION"
    else:
        return "CRITICAL ISSUE"
```

### Executive Priority Logic
```python
def determine_executive_priority(avg_score, companies, critical_mentions):
    if avg_score >= 4.0 and companies >= 5:
        return "IMMEDIATE ACTION"
    elif avg_score >= 3.5 and critical_mentions >= 3:
        return "HIGH PRIORITY"
    elif avg_score >= 3.0 and companies >= 3:
        return "MEDIUM PRIORITY"
    else:
        return "MONITOR"
```
