1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

Raw Transcript:
Moderator 2 (00:00:06 - 00:00:10)
So this interview is being recorded. Are you. Are you okay with that?
Mike Murphy (00:00:10 - 00:00:11)
Yeah, that's fine.
Moderator 2 (00:00:11 - 00:00:28)
Okay. So I'm with Bard Wins. As you know, we're a research firm and working with Indicia, basically to understand your experience with it, you know, how they can do something better or if not, you know, what is it that you need?
Mike Murphy (00:00:29 - 00:00:29)
Sure.
Moderator 2 (00:00:30 - 00:00:48)
So, and all of this is just going to be put in a report to be shared with the client. So you can choose if, you know, you want your name there or if it's anonymous. Most likely it's. All the responses are going to be grouped together. It's more a collective report that's going to them.
Mike Murphy (00:00:48 - 00:00:48)
Sure.
Moderator 2 (00:00:49 - 00:01:01)
Yeah. Just to let you know so that we're absolutely transparent about this. So tell me something about yourself and your company and how do you. What was your position there?
Mike Murphy (00:01:02 - 00:02:59)
Sure. So we are a corporate incentive company. We help businesses incentivize either their customers or their employees. Customers is usually to do some type of action. We want you to sign up for this service. We want you to do paperless billing, things like that. Employees. It could be anything from anniversary holidays, service programs, safety, things like that. So we've actually, I've been in the industry for 23 years. This business has been around since 2011. We, I believe, originally started. So I'm. I'm VP of Operations. In the past, I was over all of our supply chain vendor management and those types of things. We have a warehouse. We. We used to have a warehouse that was about 30,000 square feet. And when Covid happened, we downsized and moved into a smaller one, I think just about like everyone else in the world, of course. And so we actually, as far as Indisha goes, we started using them when we partnered with a warehouse services company who came in and gave us a software as a service package for us to scan, print, pack, and ship everything. Right. So we use them as one of our postage providers. We also used UPS and FedEx, but the rates ended up being significantly better through the post office. So we ended up using Indisha more.
Moderator 2 (00:02:59 - 00:03:00)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:03:01 - 00:04:02)
In 2020, again, Covid, we had a couple of very large enterprise clients who were shipping a lot of packages each month that went bankrupt. And so we lost that business. Right. And so we saw a decline in our postage rates both in how much we were shipping out and what we were actually paying per package. And so, you know, originally we had someone who was dedicated to our account from Indisha. And as those numbers started dropping down, we dropped from a particular service level down to, okay, you're not quite as important as you used to be. And then even that person who was over our account turned us over to just general customer service.
Moderator 2 (00:04:03 - 00:04:04)
I see. Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:04:05 - 00:05:07)
Which is. I understand. Right. But it became increasingly more difficult for us to get in contact with people when we needed to. And then also there were a lot of things we were trying to look at in terms of what services we were using, how we could lower our freight cost. And so we went back and forth. We have netsuite as our warehouse management package now. Right. And they have a third party. That third party does all of our scanning for our orders. And they had previously integrated with Indisha. When we started looking at some better service rates, they wanted to move us to a different platform of theirs. But Indisha was not an option. They used a different service called Easy Post.
Moderator 2 (00:05:07 - 00:05:08)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:05:09 - 00:05:41)
And so basically, from not getting the same support level that we were getting before, not getting the same rates that we were before, we had to look at other options. And this was the best option for us. And we've actually, by making that switch, we've cut our postage rates almost in half. So it was a change that I didn't necessarily want to make, but it turned out to be the best option for us.
Moderator 2 (00:05:44 - 00:06:01)
So help me understand this. When you were working with Indicia, you had somebody like a point of contact with whom you used to communicate, and this person, as your business with them went down, turn your account over to customer service. Is that right?
Mike Murphy (00:06:01 - 00:06:19)
So there was actually two levels. So we had our main contact, who then turned it over to a different main contact, who then turned it over to customer, general customer service. So it was kind of a step down number one. Step down number two.
Moderator 2 (00:06:19 - 00:06:27)
Okay, so and how often was your interaction with this person? I mean, did you need to contact them often or maybe once a week or how often was that?
Mike Murphy (00:06:27 - 00:06:33)
No. So the original one, we would check in maybe once a month.
Moderator 2 (00:06:34 - 00:06:34)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:06:34 - 00:06:46)
Every other week at most. Just kind of, what's going on? What kind of volume? How can we help you? And that was really good for probably two years.
Moderator 2 (00:06:47 - 00:06:49)
So they were checking in with you very much.
Mike Murphy (00:06:52 - 00:08:02)
Fantastic support. It would really. The only time where we would need to reach out is if we had some kind of service issue, whether it was the software wasn't working or rates weren't being applied properly, something like that. But that was very rare. When we moved down to that next person, we. We got to a place where we needed a little more in terms of reporting. And so I would reach out, hey, here's the reporting that we're looking for, Wouldn't hear anything for a little bit. Reach out again, hey, I still need these reports. It's pretty critical to our business. And then finally he's just said, yeah, we're, we're handing you over to general customer care. Customer care would say, well, you need to talk with this person. And this person would say, well, you need to talk with customer care. And so we just kind of got in that loop of we don't know who to talk with, and no one seems to want to help us, so.
Moderator 2 (00:08:02 - 00:08:16)
Correct. Okay, and so when you were facing all this, did you decide, are you one of the decision makers or did somebody else decide, hey, we need to look at somebody else for this?
Mike Murphy (00:08:16 - 00:08:18)
Oh, no, it was. It was very much my decision.
Moderator 2 (00:08:18 - 00:08:23)
Okay, yes. So how did you start doing that process? I mean, how did you start looking out?
Mike Murphy (00:08:23 - 00:09:59)
So one of the things that kind of came up in those conversations was it's not a limit. It's. This is how it was presented to me. It's not a limitation of Indisha. It's a limitation of NET Suite, or it's a limitation on RF Smart, the third party that we use for pack and ship. And so through that process, I wasn't getting any support from Indisha. So I started Talking with the NetSuite and RF smart folks and said, hey, you know, here's what we're trying to do. They're saying, it's your fault. What can we do? And so Indisha gave us no solutions. Netsuite and rsmart said, well, of course we can do that, and here's how we would go about doing it. And so that was maybe six months of research and making sure that what we were looking for could actually happen. And the only change that needed to happen on their end was moving from Indisha to this other third or fourth party at this point, Easy Post. So, and with Easy Post, I get. I have a dedicated support person, a dedicated salesperson, and then a dedicated IT resource who I can at any point, in any time call and say, here's my problem. And usually within an hour, I've got a response and a solution.
Moderator 2 (00:10:01 - 00:10:08)
Okay, so when you were using netsuite, did you. Did Indicia know that you were using netsuite or was this.
Mike Murphy (00:10:08 - 00:10:13)
Oh, yeah, yeah. Indicia was integrated into both RF Smart and to NetSuite.
Moderator 2 (00:10:13 - 00:10:23)
Okay, so did you reach out to them and say, hey, something's not working. Could you suggest. Okay, yes and yeah. So any answer back, okay, no.
Mike Murphy (00:10:23 - 00:10:34)
There were two things really that we were looking for. One was Additional reporting. And then the second was the post office implemented a new service called Ground Advantage.
Moderator 2 (00:10:34 - 00:10:35)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:10:35 - 00:10:42)
Basically Priority Mail that takes a day or two slower, but you get a much better rate on it.
Moderator 2 (00:10:42 - 00:10:42)
Right.
Mike Murphy (00:10:43 - 00:10:46)
And Indisha said, sorry, that's not an option.
Moderator 2 (00:10:46 - 00:10:47)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:10:47 - 00:11:21)
And when we pressed them on it, it was, sorry, that's not an option because it's not an option in NetSuite. And so that's when we started reaching out to NetSuite and to RSMART saying, hey, they're saying we can't do this because you can't do this. And they said we can do it, we just can't do it with Indisha because they don't offer it. Easypost offers it. So that was when we started looking at, okay, do it. A, is this really offered? And B, how easy is it for us to make that change?
Moderator 2 (00:11:22 - 00:11:23)
Was it easy?
Mike Murphy (00:11:23 - 00:11:24)
Very easy.
Moderator 2 (00:11:24 - 00:11:25)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:11:25 - 00:11:26)
Very easy.
Moderator 2 (00:11:26 - 00:11:32)
And how does easypost sort of compare? Yeah.
Mike Murphy (00:11:32 - 00:12:36)
So in addition to the resources, the dedicated resources that we have there, they have a portal that is very, very easy to use. I get an extreme amount of reporting. I can go in and apply all kinds of filters and make sure that it's shows up exactly how I want to see it. And then with how they integrate with our smart, I get a dashboard that shows me, here's your 30, 60, 90 day spend, here's how long it took for each of those packages to be delivered. Here's a map of the US and here's how many went to this state, this state, this date. So it's the user experience is significantly better. The interface that we have to use daily is significantly better. If I need a report, whether it's a standard report or a customer report, it's very simple for me to go in and build that report and get that data and then send it on to the people that I need to. So.
Moderator 2 (00:12:36 - 00:12:38)
And how long have you been. Sorry, I didn't mean to.
Mike Murphy (00:12:38 - 00:12:39)
No, no, you're good.
Moderator 2 (00:12:40 - 00:12:42)
How long have you been using easypost?
Mike Murphy (00:12:42 - 00:12:50)
We started using Easy Post probably August of last year. So right. At a year.
Moderator 2 (00:12:50 - 00:12:52)
About a year. Okay, okay.
Mike Murphy (00:12:53 - 00:13:09)
And, and good. In that year, no one from Indisha has reached out to say, hey, where are you guys? What happened? Like, we just never heard from anyone. So.
Moderator 2 (00:13:09 - 00:13:10)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:13:10 - 00:13:11)
Yeah.
Moderator 2 (00:13:13 - 00:13:16)
Even. I'm sorry, I don't even work. I feel bad.
Mike Murphy (00:13:18 - 00:13:18)
Yeah.
Moderator 2 (00:13:19 - 00:13:25)
Like what were they thinking? Yeah, but I don't know. So I'm just a third party getting response.
Mike Murphy (00:13:25 - 00:13:26)
Oh, I know, I know.
Moderator 2 (00:13:27 - 00:13:42)
Yeah, but yeah, it seems. Yeah. Okay. And, and have you faced any kind of pain points or anything with easypost that you just. Just something that you feel, hey, maybe this could be better. I'm not talking with. So just with them per se.
Mike Murphy (00:13:42 - 00:13:57)
The only issue that I have with Easy Post, as it came out of the box, versus what we had with Indisha. Indisha, I could pay with our American Express.
Moderator 2 (00:13:58 - 00:13:59)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:13:59 - 00:14:19)
And it would once, I think once we got to $2,500 in our account, it would load another 2500 or another 5000 or whatever. And $2,500 of load cost me $2,500. Right. So there weren't any credit card fees.
Moderator 2 (00:14:19 - 00:14:20)
Or anything like that.
Mike Murphy (00:14:21 - 00:15:32)
Once we were talking with Easy Post, my options were ACH payment, which takes three to five days to clear, or credit card, but I have to pay. I think it was a. Almost 3% fee on the credit card. So the challenge for me was, hey, I have this large project that comes in that I need to ship out. I need to pay you for postage, but now I have to wait three to five days to use that postage because my money's got to clear because I'm not going to pay an extra 3%. And so I reached out to our resources and said, hey, here are the problems. How can we fix this? And they got it set up to where as soon as I make that ACH payment, rather than waiting for it to clear, they go ahead and apply that to our account. So if I say, hey, add $5,000, I basically have a line of credit up to $50,000 a week that I can spend without actually having to wait on those funds to show up.
Moderator 2 (00:15:33 - 00:15:35)
How does that work? What is ach? Just help me understand.
Mike Murphy (00:15:35 - 00:15:41)
The ACH is basically I'm transferring money from my bank account to your bank account.
Moderator 2 (00:15:41 - 00:15:42)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:15:42 - 00:15:56)
And I hit a button that says pay them. But when I say pay them, there's a whole process that it has to go through. It has to be pulled out of my account, it has to be transferred to your account, and there's usually a one to two day waiting period.
Moderator 2 (00:15:56 - 00:15:57)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:15:57 - 00:15:59)
Once it gets to your account for those funds to be applied.
Moderator 2 (00:16:00 - 00:16:00)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:16:00 - 00:16:01)
So.
Moderator 2 (00:16:01 - 00:16:03)
And now how it's set up is there's no waiting.
Mike Murphy (00:16:03 - 00:16:18)
Yeah. So as soon as I say send those funds, those funds are still all being processed in the background, but they get a notification that says, I sent the money, it will show up in three to four days. They just go ahead and apply that credit.
Moderator 2 (00:16:18 - 00:16:24)
They're okay with that. Okay. Okay. But with Indicia, it was instant because it was just a card.
Mike Murphy (00:16:24 - 00:16:25)
Correct.
Moderator 2 (00:16:25 - 00:16:35)
American Express Correct. Okay. Okay. So. And you're happy with the. The way they handled all of this and.
Mike Murphy (00:16:35 - 00:16:57)
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, I basically came out and said, hey, here's my problem. They said, let us work on a solution. The next morning, they came back and said, here's what we can do for you. There wasn't any paperwork or anything crazy that I needed to fill out. They just took care of it and said, here's how it works going forward. So.
Moderator 2 (00:16:58 - 00:17:04)
Okay, taking a step back, when you were using Indisha, how long did you use it for before all of this happened?
Mike Murphy (00:17:04 - 00:17:13)
Oh, we used Indisha. Probably 2013 was when we started using them.
Moderator 2 (00:17:13 - 00:17:14)
A long time.
Mike Murphy (00:17:14 - 00:17:21)
Yeah. So close to 10 years, 11 years, 12 years, maybe. So.
Moderator 2 (00:17:22 - 00:17:31)
And. And in this, at that point of time, before your business, you know, went and they. They switched you to another, like, tier two person or whatever.
Mike Murphy (00:17:31 - 00:17:32)
Yeah.
Moderator 2 (00:17:32 - 00:17:42)
At that point in time, were. Were they, like, open or were they super responsive to you when you went to them with, you know, a question, or did they make you wait or how was it?
Mike Murphy (00:17:42 - 00:18:02)
They were very responsive. Sometimes it would take. The initial response was fast. Sometimes it would take a week to actually, you know, if I need a report. Okay, I understand you need this report. Do you need anything else besides this? No. Okay, let me go get it.
Moderator 2 (00:18:02 - 00:18:03)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:18:03 - 00:18:05)
A week later. Okay, here's your report.
Moderator 2 (00:18:06 - 00:18:06)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:18:07 - 00:18:15)
So granted, that was years and years and years ago, so, you know, things are all a little bit more automated these days.
Moderator 2 (00:18:16 - 00:18:17)
Sure. Technology is gone.
Mike Murphy (00:18:17 - 00:18:19)
Technology has changed a lot.
Moderator 2 (00:18:20 - 00:18:29)
Is like a click. Yeah. Understand. No, I was just trying to understand, you know, what was their sort of services before and how did that change? What was your problem? So.
Mike Murphy (00:18:29 - 00:19:01)
And. And, you know, in fairness to them, too, this first few years that we were using them, we were brand new in terms of our business, so we were ramping up. It was really 2017, probably where we started seeing a lot of volume going through, which was when Selena, our account manager, was assigned to us. And so she had us from probably late 2017, 2018 to 2020.
Moderator 2 (00:19:02 - 00:19:04)
Okay, was that the first person or the second?
Mike Murphy (00:19:04 - 00:19:05)
That was first person.
Moderator 2 (00:19:05 - 00:19:07)
And who is the second person?
Mike Murphy (00:19:07 - 00:19:08)
A guy named Taylor.
Moderator 2 (00:19:09 - 00:19:09)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:19:10 - 00:19:23)
And so Taylor took over probably 20. Late 2020, early 2021, and had us for maybe a year during COVID That was the co.
Moderator 2 (00:19:23 - 00:19:24)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:19:24 - 00:19:28)
Yeah. And then we transferred over to just their general customer care.
Moderator 2 (00:19:28 - 00:19:33)
Customer service. Yeah. Were you pushed around a lot in customer care? I know what happens when.
Mike Murphy (00:19:33 - 00:19:43)
Even when you call, it was somebody different every time. Yeah, yeah. Which is, you know, because then, then you have to explain what it is you do.
Moderator 2 (00:19:43 - 00:19:44)
All over again.
Mike Murphy (00:19:44 - 00:20:06)
Yeah, all over again to every new person you talk with. And if I need a report, why do you need that report? Here's what I need. You know, so it's basically just having access to push a button and get that report. I have to go explain what we need every time. And it looks a little different and feels a little different every time we get it.
Moderator 2 (00:20:06 - 00:20:18)
Sure, sure, sure. Okay. Okay. Do you, I know you mentioned other providers. Do you use like FedEx or UPS, USP, who do you use?
Mike Murphy (00:20:18 - 00:20:47)
So we use Easy Post for all of our mail Service. We use UPS. We don't use FedEx anymore. And then RF Smart, which is that third party that integrates with NetSuite, they also have freight partners so that we can send things on pallets and we can price that out through their system and choose.
Moderator 2 (00:20:47 - 00:20:50)
What is it called again? Arts.
Mike Murphy (00:20:50 - 00:20:51)
RF Smart.
Moderator 2 (00:20:51 - 00:20:53)
Oh, RF Smart. Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:20:54 - 00:20:55)
They're based in Tampa.
Moderator 2 (00:20:55 - 00:20:56)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:20:56 - 00:20:57)
Yeah.
Moderator 2 (00:20:57 - 00:21:01)
So they're the ones who integrate the Easy Post.
Mike Murphy (00:21:01 - 00:21:01)
Yep.
Moderator 2 (00:21:01 - 00:21:02)
Easy Post with.
Mike Murphy (00:21:03 - 00:21:19)
Yeah. And they, you. I'm sure they, to some extent they still do partner with Indisha. It's just not for this particular service level package that we use so that we get the better rates on postage.
Moderator 2 (00:21:20 - 00:21:30)
So they integrate easypost with netsuite. Right. Okay, okay. And. And you say that they still work with Indicia, but just not because they don't.
Mike Murphy (00:21:30 - 00:21:38)
Yeah, I would have to assume that they do because the package that we used to have with them before switching last year, we were using Indisha.
Moderator 2 (00:21:38 - 00:21:39)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:21:41 - 00:21:51)
So anybody who's still on that tier, I would assume still uses Indicia. Maybe they have the option to use Indisha or easypost. But.
Moderator 2 (00:21:52 - 00:22:00)
Yeah, but it was the netsuite people who came to you and said, hey, we can do this. But we, you know, if you go with Easy Posts instead of indicator. Right.
Mike Murphy (00:22:00 - 00:22:01)
Yep.
Moderator 2 (00:22:01 - 00:22:10)
Okay. All right. So did you ever think of, you know, did you, I mean, were you happy with their suggestion or did you say, hey, let me look at something else?
Mike Murphy (00:22:10 - 00:22:23)
And yeah, so I, I did. So part of it was it's the combination of NetSuite and RF Smart together. Who said this is the easy.
Moderator 2 (00:22:23 - 00:22:25)
Both of them together. Okay. Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:22:26 - 00:22:33)
We did look at a couple of other options right off top of my head. I couldn't tell you which ones those were.
Moderator 2 (00:22:33 - 00:22:34)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:22:34 - 00:22:51)
But I know at least one or two of them would have required us to look at someone other than RF Smart. And it just didn't make like RF Smart is pretty woven into what we do daily. So replacing NetSuite or replacing RF Smart wasn't a solution for us.
Moderator 2 (00:22:52 - 00:22:52)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:22:53 - 00:22:53)
So.
Moderator 2 (00:22:55 - 00:23:02)
And do you know about Andisha's like the affiliation with shipstation API? Like it's a multi carrier solution?
Mike Murphy (00:23:02 - 00:23:06)
Yeah. So we looked at one point we looked at ShipStation.
Moderator 2 (00:23:06 - 00:23:07)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:23:09 - 00:23:30)
But again, I think integrating across multiple different platforms, that was going to be a pretty big lift for our IT team. And so it just made the most sense to, to go with the easiest path. Yeah. Unless there was going to be some major reason not to. And so far there has not been.
Moderator 2 (00:23:31 - 00:23:36)
Okay, so do you think you would ever use ShipStation? I mean, at some future point?
Mike Murphy (00:23:36 - 00:23:44)
Just because I think it's a possibility. So we're actually, we have one year left on our agreement with netsuite.
Moderator 2 (00:23:44 - 00:23:44)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:23:46 - 00:24:18)
We have talked with them about extending out three to five years from now, but that we haven't made any real progress there. So we've looked at a couple of other options and one of those is Intuit. They have a new platform which I think, if I'm not mistaken, they, they basically function with modules and I think shipstation plugs into the Intuit model.
Moderator 2 (00:24:18 - 00:24:20)
I see it integrates with them. Okay. Yes.
Mike Murphy (00:24:21 - 00:24:22)
So.
Moderator 2 (00:24:23 - 00:24:23)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:24:23 - 00:24:43)
Yeah. The challenge for us is like with NetSuite, it's not just our pick pack and ship, it's our accounting. We have our CRM, all these different things that plug into it. So it's not just it is my team that's impacted by it, but it's really the whole organization that's tied into it.
Moderator 2 (00:24:44 - 00:24:47)
And you said your contract is coming up for renewal, Right, the netsuite.
Mike Murphy (00:24:48 - 00:24:49)
So we've got one year left on it.
Moderator 2 (00:24:49 - 00:24:50)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:24:50 - 00:25:00)
Yeah. Actually, what's today? The 30th, August 1st of 2026 is our expiration on our current agreement.
Moderator 2 (00:25:01 - 00:25:01)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:25:01 - 00:25:03)
So literally a year and two days.
Moderator 2 (00:25:03 - 00:25:07)
Will they reach out to you and you know, ask you if you want to renew or is it auto?
Mike Murphy (00:25:07 - 00:25:28)
Oh yeah, yeah, they've already, we're already having those discussions. Yeah. I think part of the challenge for us is we're pretty low maintenance. Like we're not bugging people all day every day with hey, we need this or hey, we need that, but when we need something, we need it.
Moderator 2 (00:25:28 - 00:25:28)
Right.
Mike Murphy (00:25:30 - 00:25:47)
And so, you know, I understand that we're going to see an increase, but it needs to be a reasonable increase, you know, to come back and say, well, it's going up X percent when you're not having to do anything different. We're not doing anything different.
Moderator 2 (00:25:49 - 00:25:50)
So how do you justify that?
Mike Murphy (00:25:51 - 00:25:58)
Yeah. So that's where we are now is trying to see what makes sense from a, from an increase standpoint.
Moderator 2 (00:25:59 - 00:26:07)
Okay. Do you think, you know, if Andisha were to come back to you or do something different, you would maybe consider them at all? I mean.
Mike Murphy (00:26:07 - 00:26:28)
Oh, yeah, it's. I'm always open to it. You know, I, if they ever. They haven't come to us since we left to say, hey, what happened? So I have a hard time thinking they would come out and say, oh, hey, we miss you. Why don't you consider this? But yeah, I would definitely be open to it.
Moderator 2 (00:26:29 - 00:26:34)
Okay. And what would they need to do to get your business back? I'm just trying to understand.
Mike Murphy (00:26:34 - 00:27:01)
Yeah. So I think having, even if it's not like someone that I can get 24 7, just a person, like an actual. Here is one resource that we have or two resources that we have who I can reach out to who understand what it is that we do. And it's the same person every time so that I'm not having to go to 10 different people.
Moderator 2 (00:27:02 - 00:27:04)
I think start all over again.
Mike Murphy (00:27:05 - 00:27:44)
That is step number one to getting us to, to have that conversation and then open up some of the shipping options for us that weren't available before. So like for example, from we're in Chattanooga, Tennessee, for me to ship a package through Priority Mail from Chattanooga to California used to cost me somewhere around $8 and 50 cents. I can do that today for roughly 450.
Moderator 2 (00:27:45 - 00:27:46)
Wow.
Mike Murphy (00:27:48 - 00:27:51)
By taking an extra day or two for it to be delivered.
Moderator 2 (00:27:51 - 00:27:51)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:27:52 - 00:28:13)
And literally all that that required was instead of checking this box, I need to check this box. It's. It was that simple with easypost. So if they had those solutions available, we'd definitely be open to, to having those discussions.
Moderator 2 (00:28:15 - 00:28:20)
But you said NetSuite is, it's. It's used everywhere, like other departments use it as well, right?
Mike Murphy (00:28:20 - 00:28:21)
Sure. Yeah.
Moderator 2 (00:28:22 - 00:28:23)
So, yeah.
Mike Murphy (00:28:23 - 00:28:58)
So it would need to be like, if we had to go with easypost operates in that one little space. Right. Indisha operates on that one little space. So both of them are just plugging into one piece of our whole business. Whichever piece we end up choosing for the rest of everything, we would definitely have to have it. The ability to integrate with whichever solution we go with, whether it's netsuite or someone else.
Moderator 2 (00:28:58 - 00:29:01)
And who makes that decision. Would that just be you? Would that be somebody else?
Mike Murphy (00:29:01 - 00:29:16)
That is, that would be. For the holistic version is going to be me and then our COO and then our VP of it. The three of us would work together on that.
Moderator 2 (00:29:17 - 00:29:26)
Okay, but this is the time when you're making that, when you're at least deciding, you know, whether you want to renew the contract or whether you want to go with somebody else.
Mike Murphy (00:29:26 - 00:29:35)
We actually had. Was today, Wednesday, Friday of last week, we had our first demo with Intuit.
Moderator 2 (00:29:35 - 00:29:36)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:29:36 - 00:29:48)
So we're, we're actively having discussions at this point on what we're going to do next, whether it's stick with Netsuite or seriously start looking at other options.
Moderator 2 (00:29:49 - 00:29:52)
And does NDC work with Intuit? I mean, does it plug in? Do you know?
Mike Murphy (00:29:53 - 00:29:54)
No, I don't know.
Moderator 2 (00:29:55 - 00:30:13)
Okay. Okay. Okay. So is there anything else that you want to share either about Indicia or about, you know, Easy Pay or, or any of the other providers, you know, stood out in your memory or, or was a big pain point for you or whatever? Anything.
Mike Murphy (00:30:14 - 00:30:32)
Nothing big that we haven't gone over already. You know, I think it was for when we had. Was a good solution until eventually it became not a good solution. And then what we have now is a good solution and so far it's stayed a good solution. So.
Moderator 2 (00:30:33 - 00:30:38)
So would it take a lot from them for you to go back, or would you still be open?
Mike Murphy (00:30:38 - 00:31:21)
Well, I think the problem for everybody is that they don't really control the rates. Right. So the Post Office is who controls all of that? FedEx or UPS or, or whatever. But it's the services that they offer within the post office and UPS and FedEx and whoever. So, you know, I think everybody offers in terms of like, Easy Post. I don't pay Easy Post anything for their service. They get money off of my. The balance of cash that I leave with them each week. They earn interest on all that. But yeah.
Moderator 2 (00:31:21 - 00:31:28)
Oh, I see. Is that how they work? I mean, you don't pay them directly? Okay, no, but did you pay INDISA directly or.
Mike Murphy (00:31:28 - 00:31:33)
No, no. Maybe something like 25 or 30 bucks a month, something like that.
Moderator 2 (00:31:34 - 00:31:34)
Just for service.
Mike Murphy (00:31:35 - 00:31:39)
Okay, but yeah, no, I don't pay. I don't pay Easy Post anything.
Moderator 2 (00:31:40 - 00:31:42)
So that has to be attractive.
Mike Murphy (00:31:43 - 00:31:44)
Very.
Moderator 2 (00:31:45 - 00:31:47)
Okay, so. Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:31:47 - 00:32:03)
But I mean, at the end of the day, you're only saving a few hundred dollars a year. So it's really, it really comes down to service, like what level of service you're getting and what levels of service you can use within your carriers.
Moderator 2 (00:32:03 - 00:32:11)
So, so when you say that you used to work with additional pull reports and all that. So does easypost does that for you and they don't charge you anything for that?
Mike Murphy (00:32:12 - 00:32:13)
Charge Me, Nothing.
Moderator 2 (00:32:14 - 00:32:16)
Okay. And, and it's done fast as well.
Mike Murphy (00:32:17 - 00:32:18)
Very fast.
Moderator 2 (00:32:19 - 00:32:27)
Okay. And you have somebody working with you, like, super responsive to you. Everything three. Okay. Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:32:28 - 00:32:31)
Account manager, IT and customer care.
Moderator 2 (00:32:32 - 00:32:34)
Okay. And you don't pay them anything. Wow.
Mike Murphy (00:32:34 - 00:32:35)
You don't pay them anything.
Moderator 2 (00:32:36 - 00:32:38)
Okay, well that, that's tough.
Mike Murphy (00:32:38 - 00:32:57)
It's. It's tough. So that's why I say I'm always open to, to conversations and you know, considering any option that's out there for us. But at the end of the day, I gotta weigh cost versus service versus my actual out the door expense on packages.
Moderator 2 (00:32:58 - 00:33:03)
So, so how, what is their business model? How are they making their money if they don't charge you anything?
Mike Murphy (00:33:03 - 00:33:18)
So my guess, a couple things. I think all the partners who they work with. So like with RF Smart, I pay our Smart yearly. I pay NetSuite yearly for service.
Moderator 2 (00:33:19 - 00:33:19)
Sure.
Mike Murphy (00:33:19 - 00:33:55)
My guess is they get some level of commission coming back in from that. But then also, you know, if they've got 10,000 customers like me who are paying them thousands of dollars each week and it's just sitting in a fund to draw down off of and that's just sitting in a fund to earn like we do, we do that similarly with our customers too. Whoever prepays or has a drawdown account, we have that sitting in a money market account that gets 4 or 5% just sitting there.
Moderator 2 (00:33:55 - 00:34:00)
Oh, sure. So yeah, yeah, yeah. All the banks do it, so it's fine.
Mike Murphy (00:34:00 - 00:34:07)
Yeah, it's. It's what a bank does. Right. Let me hold your money for you and make, make money off of your money.
Moderator 2 (00:34:07 - 00:34:09)
I know I make it look like I'm doing you a favor.
Mike Murphy (00:34:09 - 00:34:11)
I'm doing you a favor always.
Moderator 2 (00:34:12 - 00:34:16)
Okay, well, that's all the questions I have today, so.
Mike Murphy (00:34:16 - 00:34:16)
Okay.
Moderator 2 (00:34:17 - 00:34:20)
And you will receive the email from the rewards platform.
Mike Murphy (00:34:21 - 00:34:21)
Okay.
Moderator 2 (00:34:21 - 00:34:27)
Within like 48 hours. So look out for that. And yeah, do reach out if that doesn't come through. So.
Mike Murphy (00:34:28 - 00:34:28)
Okay.
Moderator 2 (00:34:28 - 00:34:29)
Okay.
Mike Murphy (00:34:29 - 00:34:31)
Yeah. Thank you very much. It's a good conversation.
Moderator 2 (00:34:31 - 00:34:32)
Yeah. Thanks so much.
Mike Murphy (00:34:32 - 00:34:33)
Bye.
Moderator 2 (00:34:33 - 00:34:33)
Bye.
",,8/12/2025 9:25am,"Endicia Churn Discussion Guide V1
Common Desired Learnings Across Stakeholders
1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

1. Who was involved in the decision to reduce or stop using Endicia (e.g., logistics, IT, procurement)? Who were the key influencers or decision-makers? 

1. How did Endicia’s account management or sales team engage with your team during your usage or decision-making process? 

Multi-Homing Behavior and Barriers to ShipStation API (6 minutes)
Objective: Investigate why customers split shipping volume and what prevents adoption of ShipStation API.
Client Assumptions: Customers multi-home due to carrier needs or tech partner limitations, and integration costs deter switching to ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
1. Do you currently split your shipping volume across multiple providers? (e.g., USPS, UPS, FedEx) 
    a. IF YES: Why do you use multiple providers? 

1. Were you aware of Endicia’s affiliation with ShipStation API, a multi-carrier solution? 
    a. IF YES: What barriers prevented you from adopting it? (e.g., integration costs, tech partner limitations) 


Retention Strategies and Incentives (6 minutes)
Objective: Determine what incentives could retain or attract customers to Endicia or ShipStation API.
Client Assumptions: Incentives like revenue sharing, free service periods, or compliance management could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
1. What could Endicia have done that would have encouraged your company to maintain or increase your usage with them? 
    a. PROBE: revenue sharing, no label fees, free service periods, compliance management?

1. What would make a multi-carrier solution like ShipStation API more appealing, considering your current tech stack or operational needs? 

Wrap-Up (4 minutes)
Objective: Capture additional insights and future considerations to inform Endicia’s retention and growth strategies.
Client Assumptions: Regional carriers and streamlined pricing could be differentiators, but customers need clear incentives to justify integration efforts (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
1. Are there any other factors or experiences with Endicia, USPS, or other providers you’d like to share? 

1. What would make you consider returning to or increasing usage with Endicia or exploring their broader solutions, such as ShipStation API, in the future?

1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

Raw Transcript:
Buried Wins Moderator (00:00:16 - 00:00:18)
Hello? Hi, Ryan?
Ryan Westberg (00:00:19 - 00:00:19)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:00:20 - 00:00:29)
Hi, this is Nandini. I'm with Bayard Winds. Before we start, this call is being recorded. Is that okay with you?
Ryan Westberg (00:00:29 - 00:00:29)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:00:30 - 00:00:50)
Okay, fine. All right. So we are a research firm. We're just working with Indicia to understand, you know, your experience with them, how they can improve, things like that. So just to get started, could you briefly maybe introduce yourself your role at the company?
Ryan Westberg (00:00:51 - 00:01:20)
Yep. I'm Ryan Westberg, founder and CEO of Fan of a Fan. We're a full service merchandising company and 3PL. So we use NDC more on the 3PL side of the business. So we operate and we fulfill for our own brands, but also for other e commerce brands. And so we use Indicia to plug into our WMS platform called ShipHero and that's, that's how we utilize it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:20 - 00:01:26)
So could you elaborate a little bit more about 3pl? Because I understand you're a graphic designer, is that right?
Ryan Westberg (00:01:27 - 00:01:30)
No, the warehousing side is where we use in dc.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:30 - 00:01:31)
Okay.
Ryan Westberg (00:01:31 - 00:01:35)
Warehousing, shipping and fulfillment, e commerce brands.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:35 - 00:01:38)
Okay. So what does 3PL stand for?
Ryan Westberg (00:01:39 - 00:01:40)
Third party logistics.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:40 - 00:01:53)
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. I walked into that one. Okay, so. So I understand. Have you reduced using them or stopped using them completely in this year?
Ryan Westberg (00:01:54 - 00:01:55)
We've reduced using it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:56 - 00:01:56)
Okay.
Ryan Westberg (00:01:56 - 00:02:02)
Because we've moved more to Shipo in the past few months.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:03 - 00:02:04)
Is it Ship up or Shipo?
Ryan Westberg (00:02:05 - 00:02:05)
Shipo.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:06 - 00:02:08)
Okay. That's S H I P P O.
Ryan Westberg (00:02:09 - 00:02:10)
Correct? Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:10 - 00:02:13)
Okay. And why have you moved to them? I mean, is there a reason?
Ryan Westberg (00:02:14 - 00:02:34)
Yeah, much more user friendly. It just is an easier to use platform and it's. Yeah, just an overall better experience. And dc, transparently, the dashboard hasn't been updated in a long time. It's doesn't feel as just user friendly in general.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:36 - 00:02:40)
Did you have like issues with it? Did you have to reach out to them or anything like that or.
Ryan Westberg (00:02:40 - 00:02:51)
No, Shippo just came and was doing basically the same thing. No additional costs or anything. It was just easier to use. So we moved over most of our volume to them.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:52 - 00:02:58)
How do you get in touch with them? Did they approach you or did you consider like many solution providers or how did that.
Ryan Westberg (00:02:58 - 00:03:09)
Checked out? A few, but yeah, asked around what other people were using and some people recommended Shippo. We checked it out and yeah, it was super easy to integrate and get things going quickly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:11 - 00:03:18)
And what is it that Indicia is giving you that you're still, you know, you're using them for something and then moving the bulk of your things to sipo?
Ryan Westberg (00:03:18 - 00:03:41)
Yeah, for some reason Some of their rates on like small package come out a little bit cheaper and so. And DCA will still win some of the volume there. Yeah, exactly. So we have three rates competing against each other with usps, we have Shippo and dc and then we have an NSA with USPS Direct.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:42 - 00:03:42)
Okay.
Ryan Westberg (00:03:43 - 00:03:48)
USPS Modern. So they're all competing for the, the best rates.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:49 - 00:03:53)
Okay. And what has your experience been with Shippo so far?
Ryan Westberg (00:03:54 - 00:04:01)
Been great. Yeah. Zero issues. It's been pretty, pretty easy to use and yeah, no issues.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:02 - 00:04:05)
Would that be like the main thing for you, like ease of use?
Ryan Westberg (00:04:06 - 00:04:27)
Yeah, yeah, for sure. If pricing is comparable, I'd rather just use something that's easy to use. And they gave us a direct account manager that is always following up, making sure we're good there, all that. But this is literally the first time I've ever even interacted with anyone from Indicia, so. Or I know you're not even with Indicia, but they're clearly doing research.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:29 - 00:04:36)
Yes. Oh, so you don't, do you. You don't have anybody in like checking in on you or following up with you or anything?
Ryan Westberg (00:04:36 - 00:04:41)
Nope, never have. And I think I've been signed up for Indicia for probably eight to ten years.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:42 - 00:04:53)
I see. I didn't know that. Okay, do you typically have any questions like do you need to run reports or, or pull something for which you. You wish you had somebody, would that have helped you?
Ryan Westberg (00:04:54 - 00:05:25)
Maybe. I mean it just puts kind of a person behind the brand and makes you a little bit more loyal if you have someone to talk to if something does go wrong. Because you always sure, Chipo. At least I know someone's there. We haven't needed them, but we know there's something there. And you always, when something goes wrong, you want to know who you can go to. And yeah, nothing went wrong with Indicia. Probably have probably five questions in 10 years. But I don't want to like just call some told free number and get put on hold and not really know who to talk to.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:26 - 00:05:33)
Yeah, no, I was just trying to understand whether you would need to interact on a. Like you need somebody to check up on yours only in the case of an issue or a problem.
Ryan Westberg (00:05:34 - 00:05:41)
Yeah, I think only a problem. But yeah, the checkups are probably nice because it takes no time and don't really even utilize it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:41 - 00:05:47)
Okay, and how much does Shippo charge you? Like is it, is it an add on to something else or is it like a standalone service or.
Ryan Westberg (00:05:48 - 00:05:57)
It's a monthly service fee for the API connection and nominal. It's like maybe 50 bucks or something.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:57 - 00:06:05)
Okay, okay. And who made that decision? Like was it just you or do you have to ask other people or do you influence the decision?
Ryan Westberg (00:06:06 - 00:06:07)
It was just me.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:09 - 00:06:19)
Okay. And so you said you use UPS or usps, you. A third one was there, right?
Ryan Westberg (00:06:20 - 00:06:39)
Yeah, just for the USPS side I'm talking about. Yeah, we have Shippo and D.C. and then we have USPS Modern, which we have like a direct NSA since they started offering that about probably eight to 10 months ago. And then we also use other carriers. DHL and UPS are primaries.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:40 - 00:06:51)
And why do you use all these multiple. I mean it's. Do you find that the best way to like for your business or would one or two do or has it always.
Ryan Westberg (00:06:51 - 00:07:18)
Yeah, we need multiple carriers for multiple reasons. Dhl, we use a lot for international. UPS is much better for heavier, heavier packages, heavier box packages. UPS is much better. And yeah, we, we need, we're shipping a lot, we're shipping thousands of orders every day. So we need to have a competition between the carriers and each carrier has its own what things it's good for.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:19 - 00:07:24)
So are they like clearly defined or do they all compete just based on rates or.
Ryan Westberg (00:07:25 - 00:07:34)
Some clients don't want to work with usps so they'll have the ups. So it depends on client client basis and then depends on the product itself as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:35 - 00:07:42)
I see, I see. And were you aware that Indicia is affiliated with ShipStation API who's like a multi carrier solution.
Ryan Westberg (00:07:43 - 00:07:45)
Sorry, could you repeat that? You cut out for a sec.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:45 - 00:07:53)
Yeah. So do you know that Endicia is affiliated with ShipStation API? It's a multi carrier solution.
Ryan Westberg (00:07:53 - 00:08:09)
Yeah, yeah, I used to use shiphero when we were much smaller and yeah, it just doesn't work for our business anymore. We've. We outgrew it. But that's how I got introduced to Indicia to begin with was through ShipStation.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:09 - 00:08:15)
Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. And does that. So. But that didn't work for your business. That's what you said, right?
Ryan Westberg (00:08:17 - 00:08:24)
No longer. Yeah, I mean we're still signed up, but we use it for like single packages just because the platform is pretty easy to use and cheap.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:25 - 00:08:34)
Okay. All right. And do you think Indicia could have done anything to either retain their volume that they were doing with you or increase the usage, anything like that?
Ryan Westberg (00:08:35 - 00:08:45)
Cheaper rates they were winning. If it was so cheap that it was winning all the volume, then yeah, it wouldn't. Money always talks. Yeah, sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:45 - 00:08:50)
And what if they had somebody like you know, checking up on you like you said? Shippo does. Would that help?
Ryan Westberg (00:08:51 - 00:09:00)
Yeah, I think overall that would be improve the experience with them and probably help with retention, if that's one of their goals and concerns.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:02 - 00:09:12)
And so if, if in a perfect world all of this was done, do you think you would ever return to. Because I know you still use them, so would you consider increasing your usage with them?
Ryan Westberg (00:09:12 - 00:09:13)
Yeah, why not?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:13 - 00:09:15)
If, if somebody reached out to you.
Ryan Westberg (00:09:15 - 00:09:20)
We didn't leave because of a bad experience, so it's. Yeah, we're not. The bridge is not burned for sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:21 - 00:09:31)
Okay. Okay. And. And is there anything that stands out with shippo or USPS or any other provider that you work with? Like just, you know, that was really good about them or that was, you know.
Ryan Westberg (00:09:31 - 00:09:35)
Yeah, I think just ease of use of the platform is always good.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:36 - 00:09:38)
Did you find Indicia difficult to use at all?
Ryan Westberg (00:09:39 - 00:09:45)
Like, it's like, it's fine. It's like there's, there's no problem with it. I just don't think it's like fantastic.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:46 - 00:09:46)
Okay.
Ryan Westberg (00:09:46 - 00:09:56)
It's better than USPS's modern. Their. Their one is way worse than DC. But I'd put Shippo, then Indicia, then USPS in that rank.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:56 - 00:10:09)
Okay. Okay. Yeah, that helps. Okay. Is there anything else that you would like to call Indicia? I mean, I, I'm not working for them. I'm just like a conduit. But I would be happy to pass on anything that you want to tell them.
Ryan Westberg (00:10:11 - 00:10:14)
No, nothing really. I'm just here to answer any questions you have.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:15 - 00:10:26)
Okay. Yeah, no, I was just interested in. In what is it that Shibo did that, you know, you gave them a lot of their business, but I think so. Would you like to add anything to that or was it.
Ryan Westberg (00:10:26 - 00:10:43)
No, it's really just the platform itself. Ease of use, very easy to train someone in minutes on it and then. Yeah, having that direct account manager was definitely an overall nice experience. Just knowing who. Who to go to, if something, where to go wrong, because I think those are.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:43 - 00:10:45)
How often do they check up on you?
Ryan Westberg (00:10:47 - 00:10:57)
I don't know, maybe once a month. But they make themselves available and yeah, just having an account rep and most of the time I don't even answer the email, but it's just nice knowing.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:57 - 00:11:00)
Yeah, of course. For sure. And do they. Did they provide the training?
Ryan Westberg (00:11:02 - 00:11:14)
They offered it, but it's so user friendly. But yeah, they did have an onboarding process for sure. And Indicia, I don't believe had that, but it's easy enough to use once you've used any of the platforms.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:15 - 00:11:16)
So how Long have you used Indicia for?
Ryan Westberg (00:11:18 - 00:11:23)
I mean, between all of my company, I've. Probably 14 years.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:24 - 00:11:27)
And in 14 years, nobody has ever reached out to you?
Ryan Westberg (00:11:28 - 00:11:29)
Not that I know of.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:30 - 00:11:33)
Okay, would they have reached out to anybody else in the company or.
Ryan Westberg (00:11:33 - 00:11:46)
No, I'm the owner. This is across two companies I've started where I've used them. Um, yeah, I don't, don't think I've ever talked to anyone besides when I've had to call in because there's like an account block or something like that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:46 - 00:11:51)
Okay, and how did you start, do you remember? Like, how did you start using it this year?
Ryan Westberg (00:11:52 - 00:11:52)
Through ShipStation.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:53 - 00:12:02)
Okay. So you got to know them through that and, and started using OKAY and shipstation. I mean, again, did they bid for your business or was it one of.
Ryan Westberg (00:12:02 - 00:12:14)
The just easy to use? And I think they're like, when we were much smaller, they're super easy to use, cheap, and I think they're like the. One of the best starter platforms.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:14 - 00:12:20)
Okay, okay. But you just like automatically went to shippo because it was easier to use and everything?
Ryan Westberg (00:12:21 - 00:12:34)
Yeah, yeah. But again, it has more to do with our. We went off shipstation because we went on ship Hero because it had more to do with needing a proper WMS or more scalable WMS platform.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:35 - 00:12:51)
Okay, so I was just getting just a little confused, so help me out here. So when you're using Indicia, did you actually just find that there were some things that were maybe not that easy to use and that's why you went looking for other providers? Or did Chibo come in your radar and you said, hey, let me explain.
Ryan Westberg (00:12:51 - 00:13:15)
I just wanted to have options and was exploring just to have options, really? Because with our WMS ShipHero, we're able to plug in through API multiple accounts. So I was like, okay, why not? Let's see, let's see if their rates are. They're out of the box rates are any better and they started winning some volume there. And then I started paying attention to it more.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:16 - 00:13:18)
So the rates are comparable or cheaper.
Ryan Westberg (00:13:18 - 00:13:31)
Than on some things. The heavier stuff. It seems to win some things, but in DCO wins the super lightweight under 16 ounce stuff or under like 14 ounce, really, I think is where it shines.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:33 - 00:13:38)
Okay. All right. I don't have any more questions, so thank you so much.
Ryan Westberg (00:13:39 - 00:13:41)
Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:41 - 00:13:46)
Thanks. And they will process your payment within like the next 48 hours, I think. Okay.

",,8/12/2025 9:26am,"Endicia Churn Discussion Guide V1
Common Desired Learnings Across Stakeholders
1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

Raw Transcript:
Buried Wins Moderator (00:00:25 - 00:00:57)
It. Hello.
Kyle Fouts (00:00:59 - 00:01:00)
Good morning.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:00 - 00:01:02)
Good morning. Kyle, right?
Kyle Fouts (00:01:02 - 00:01:03)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:04 - 00:01:09)
Okay, before we get started, this interview is going to be recorded. Is that okay with you?
Kyle Fouts (00:01:09 - 00:01:10)
Yes, that's fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:11 - 00:01:19)
Okay, good. All right. Okay, so just to get started, could you introduce yourself, tell me a little bit about your company.
Kyle Fouts (00:01:20 - 00:01:43)
Yeah, sure. So, Kyle Fouts, salesforce administrator. Our company does home sleep apnea testing and one of our service lines does direct to patient delivery. That's why we were using Indusia.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:45 - 00:01:51)
Okay, you are using Indisha. So how long have you been using it before you stopped?
Kyle Fouts (00:01:52 - 00:01:58)
So they were using it before I started with the company. I would say we probably used it for at least four years.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:59 - 00:02:08)
Okay. All right. And so were you involved in the decision making to start using Indicia at all or was it before you joined?
Kyle Fouts (00:02:08 - 00:02:20)
Not to start. I did manage the Indicia platform after I got there. Yeah, that's about it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:21 - 00:02:24)
Okay. And any specific reason why you stopped?
Kyle Fouts (00:02:25 - 00:02:55)
Yeah. So we contracted directly with USPS for better volume shipping rates and a USPS integration with our third party shipping vendor became viable. So before Indisha had the best integration with them and then USPS improved their integration or the venture integration, so. But mostly, mostly cost savings.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:56 - 00:03:05)
Okay. So did you, did anybody reach out to, you know, maybe offer you a better rate or ask why you stopped or anything like that?
Kyle Fouts (00:03:08 - 00:03:26)
I might have had one follow up call, but it was months after we'd already switched. Yeah. And I mean that. We were already under contract with USPS anyway by the time they reached out. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:27 - 00:03:28)
Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:03:28 - 00:03:30)
Yeah, we didn't give Indicia a chance to negotiate.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:33 - 00:03:37)
Okay. Were there any other issues with Indisha at all, other than the rate?
Kyle Fouts (00:03:39 - 00:04:21)
I will say like tier, Tier one customer support was easy to get a hold of, but getting anything escalated past that was difficult. It was difficult to get. So we, we had a balance on. We ended up having like two, I think two Indicia accounts for some reason. And when we ended the contract we had a balance on both of those accounts and it took at least three months, maybe more, to get refunds. So the internal processing was very long. The communication was almost non existent.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:24 - 00:04:27)
So you do deposit some amount with them or something like that or.
Kyle Fouts (00:04:27 - 00:04:33)
We did, yeah. We were, we were depositing, I don't know, $15,000 a week or something.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:34 - 00:04:35)
Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:04:37 - 00:04:44)
In like $5,000 chunks? I think so, yeah. Currently we're doing 10,000 shipments a month.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:49 - 00:04:53)
And who's the third party? You said you're integrating with somebody else, right?
Kyle Fouts (00:04:53 - 00:04:54)
Zencraft.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:55 - 00:04:59)
Okay. Okay. And. And Indicia doesn't integrate with that?
Kyle Fouts (00:04:59 - 00:05:29)
No, they do so they were, they, they had, they had. At the time that we selected Indicia, they probably had the only USPS integration. I don't know if usps, I think USPS only had a direct integration at that time, which would be difficult for our small team to set up. But the vendor and USPS both improved and they have an integration now which is almost just as easy as Indicia to set up.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:30 - 00:05:32)
Okay. And they're giving you better rates.
Kyle Fouts (00:05:34 - 00:05:38)
Have an edge on, ease of setup with that vendor.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:40 - 00:05:56)
Okay. And so when, when you switched, you made this switch from Indicia, did you ever consider somebody else? Because I know you were already working with USPS to start with. Right. Did you consider other providers @ all besides USPS? Yeah.
Kyle Fouts (00:05:57 - 00:05:57)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:59 - 00:06:05)
Did you just go with them? Because, I mean, the comfort factor, I mean, you know them, they're giving you better rates, so let's just go with them.
Kyle Fouts (00:06:05 - 00:06:14)
Yeah, it's just, it was just because we could do the contract directly, the volume. We, I mean we'd reached a volume level where we could contract directly with them.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:16 - 00:06:17)
Where you couldn't do that.
Kyle Fouts (00:06:18 - 00:06:26)
I don't, I don't. We weren't aware that there were volume discounts. I don't think if there are, I'm not, I'm still not aware if there are volume discounts.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:27 - 00:06:58)
Okay. And, and just to reiterate, I mean, I know I didn't go over this. I'm not working for Indisha. I. We're working for third party research firms. So feel free to be completely honest. This is just going back as feedback to them. That's all Right. So, okay, so getting back to this, who made that decision to go, I mean, to let go of Indicia and go with usps? Was it you or was it a combination of people or how director of.
Kyle Fouts (00:06:58 - 00:07:29)
Operations started with the, the contract, USPS contract. I informed them that we could integrate because, I mean, that was another key factor was can we keep using the same process we use today in the same software? So the answer there was yes. And, and the rates were obviously better.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:30 - 00:07:39)
Okay. And have you, how has your experience been? Because I know you said it's been recent, right. Since you made that switch. So.
Kyle Fouts (00:07:42 - 00:08:50)
Man, it's got to be close to a year now. I don't know exactly what, when we switch, but experience has been pretty good. I mean, I know Indisha was, Indisha was really just like a, you know, a third party to the usps. So any like, connection, like there's been a few server outages for, you know, minimal downtime, but I assume those could have happened with Indicia, too. Account management has been better. We got dedicated account managers. Yeah. And then access to their technical team. We. We had to have access to their technical team because the setup was a little more difficult. But there is access. Even if it's slow, there is access, which we did not seem to have with Indusia. Again, initiation was simpler, so there wasn't as much technical support needed, but fair.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:50 - 00:09:07)
Okay, so when. When you were talking about. I know, just to take a step back, when you said you didn't get the refund in time or. Or any other issues that you might have encountered, was it you who had to reach out to them, or was there somebody from their side ever reaching out to you just to make sure everything was going okay or.
Kyle Fouts (00:09:08 - 00:09:23)
I don't think. I don't think anyone ever reached out from Indicia to ensure that we got the refund. I followed up on it multiple times to find out what the process was, and eventually I think I just stopped. And then finally they got the check in the mail.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:25 - 00:09:29)
Okay, so they did know that you were trying to get that processed?
Kyle Fouts (00:09:29 - 00:09:36)
Yeah, I mean, I did. I did contact someone and they responded and occasionally gave updates when asked.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:37 - 00:09:43)
Okay, and what about any kind of technical issues? Did you ever contact their team for anything else?
Kyle Fouts (00:09:44 - 00:10:01)
Yeah, I had multiple times contacted for technical support. Occasionally it would be resolved through the Tier one support. I remember one instance where I needed Tier two support, and it was very difficult. Long wait times. I don't remember the issue or the resolution, but.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:06 - 00:10:10)
Okay, so tell me a little bit. What is Tier one support? What is Tier two support?
Kyle Fouts (00:10:11 - 00:10:16)
So Tier one is like, you know, the. The general help desk. They can help you reset your password.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:16 - 00:10:17)
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:10:17 - 00:10:22)
Then Tier two would be. They can solve more complex issues, more specific.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:22 - 00:10:32)
Okay, and what is the wait time on that? I mean, so how. I'm just trying to understand how that support works. Do you contact somebody and then they route you to somebody else or.
Kyle Fouts (00:10:32 - 00:10:53)
Yeah, so I would contact Tier one. And I mean, the answer time was not. The. The wait time was not too long to get to Tier one. And then after they understood your issue, it just seemed like they didn't have the internal processes to escalate it to a Tier two. They didn't have the resources to resolve the issue. I don't know.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:55 - 00:11:00)
Okay, so then you had to take that initiative to contact Tier 2 support, or did they?
Kyle Fouts (00:11:01 - 00:11:07)
No, there was no direct contact to Tier two support. You had to call. Had to, you know, call the help desk and get escalated.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:09 - 00:11:14)
And did you have to do that multiple times before you actually went to tier 2 or.
Kyle Fouts (00:11:15 - 00:11:20)
I don't remember the specific circumstances. That's been a while back.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:20 - 00:11:33)
Okay. And. And I know you said that you joined after Indicia was already there. Right. You weren't there. So when you joined, did they give you any kind of training or how did you learn the platform? Was it easy?
Kyle Fouts (00:11:35 - 00:12:30)
It was easy, yeah. It's not very, it's not very complex. Somebody might have showed me the platform from our team. I didn't get any training from Indicia, I don't believe. But the, the setup with the, the third party vendor, I mean, you just enter username and password and then the connection exists. So it's pretty simple setup. I do remember one time we were trying to report from Indicia on, you know, quantity of shipments or cost of shipments or adjustments to shipment charges. The reporting feature was difficult to use and took a long time to load. That's probably one of the reasons I contacted support was for help with that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:39 - 00:12:58)
So when you have to build. I know. Did this mean you had to build out a report saying, you know, per month or per year or whatever? That's kind of what you were trying to do there. Do you have to contact like general customer support or is there like an account manager like, you know, that who's assigned maybe to your company or to your region or somebody like that whom you can contact?
Kyle Fouts (00:12:59 - 00:13:34)
So I do remember at one point after Indisha was acquired or something like maybe by Octane, I believe we did have a account manager and maybe she even came to the office in Atlanta and maybe the director of operations did try to get a better discount through them. Maybe that's why she was there. I don't know for sure, but I don't believe the account managers had any technical expertise with Indisha Flower. So it was just going to customer support.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:35 - 00:13:37)
Okay. Are you based out of Atlanta?
Kyle Fouts (00:13:38 - 00:13:41)
I'm not. I work remotely in Louisiana.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:41 - 00:13:43)
Okay. But the office is in Atlanta. Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:13:43 - 00:13:43)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:44 - 00:13:47)
Okay, interesting. I'm in South Carolina, just above.
Kyle Fouts (00:13:47 - 00:13:48)
Okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:48 - 00:13:55)
Yeah. All right. So do you. Do you have. You just have that one usps? You don't have. You don't use multiple providers? Correct?
Kyle Fouts (00:13:57 - 00:13:59)
We do use UPS as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:00 - 00:14:03)
Do you use FedEx or anybody else or not?
Kyle Fouts (00:14:03 - 00:14:13)
For, for the business that was using Indicia only uses USPS and UPS. Other parts of our business use FedEx.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:13 - 00:14:36)
Okay. So were you aware that Indicia has an affiliation with shipstation, which is multi carrier? Okay. And would you be interested in that? I Mean, is that something that would interest you? Because. Just because it's a multi carrier solution, if somebody were to come and talk to you about it, would you be interested in that?
Kyle Fouts (00:14:37 - 00:15:04)
So the third party vendor that we use, Zincraft, they're a multi carrier as well and it's integrated with our Salesforce platform. So I wouldn't be interested based on just that it's multi carrier. If there were significant cost savings, I'm sure that you could interest someone in our business with that, but I, I doubt that there's better cost effect. Cost effective.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:05 - 00:15:07)
Who's the vendor again? Could you repeat the name?
Kyle Fouts (00:15:07 - 00:15:08)
Z N.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:12 - 00:15:15)
Oh, and you, you're the Salesforce admin, you said. So you have a Salesforce platform?
Kyle Fouts (00:15:15 - 00:15:16)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:16 - 00:15:20)
Okay, so do you pull reports and everything off that platform.
Kyle Fouts (00:15:22 - 00:15:28)
Directly in Salesforce? Yes, it's a, it's integrated directly with Salesforce. So we have all the reporting in Salesforce.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:28 - 00:15:28)
Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:15:28 - 00:15:33)
And we had, it was the same way with Indusia. We had all of that with Indonesia as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:33 - 00:15:46)
Okay, so would you need to use Indicia to pull the reports or do you. Because I use Salesforce. So that's what I'm trying to understand. I mean, so can you pull it off of Salesforce itself? Like build your reports as long as you get the data from Indonesia?
Kyle Fouts (00:15:47 - 00:16:14)
I don't know for sure if we could have, I don't remember what the circumstances were. I don't think we had all the details in Salesforce. I think it was like, I mean there's still details we would go to USPS for, for reporting now, like payments, adjustments if, if you know, the box weighed more than we said it weighed, so they charged us 10 cents. I think those are some of the things we were trying to find out from Indisha.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:16 - 00:16:17)
That.
Kyle Fouts (00:16:18 - 00:16:19)
What's that?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:19 - 00:16:24)
Did you get any help from them? Just information even as to how, how that could be done or how that.
Kyle Fouts (00:16:24 - 00:16:33)
I do remember somebody helped me once. I, I don't have a feeling that it was successful, but I did have someone help.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:35 - 00:16:49)
Okay. Yeah, I know it must have been some time back and. Yeah. Okay, so what could they have done? I mean, if they wanted to keep your business, maintain your business, what could they have really done to do that? I mean, is there anything they could have done?
Kyle Fouts (00:16:50 - 00:17:11)
Well, they would have needed to know first of all that we were looking for lower cost. So that would be on them to stay on top of their accounts and see, you know, what they need. And then they would have had to been able to offer competitive costs or additional features. To usps.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:13 - 00:17:25)
So overall, if somebody had been checking up on you and you know, making sure that everything was okay, would that have made a difference? I mean, because then they would have known that hey, here's an issue. And you know, yeah, they definitely could.
Kyle Fouts (00:17:25 - 00:17:34)
Have known that we were looking at other options and that we were interested in cost savings. Whether or not they could have offered cost savings, I don't know.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:36 - 00:17:50)
Sure, that's on them. And so if, if something like, if you, I know you said you weren't aware of Shipstation, so if they had, you know, there have been some promotion or some kind of indication that, hey, you know, we offer this, would that have been something of interest?
Kyle Fouts (00:17:52 - 00:18:07)
Probably not. Based on, based on Ship Station, we have multi carrier. We're not, we're not dissatisfied with our, with Zincraft as a multi carrier platform. I'm not aware of Ship Station. There could be additional features that we would have been interested in. But.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:09 - 00:18:14)
Okay, and, and you said you stopped using them a year ago, right?
Kyle Fouts (00:18:15 - 00:18:16)
I don't know for sure when we.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:16 - 00:18:25)
Stop about, about that time. So did anybody reach out to you after that? Did it register that you had stopped using them?
Kyle Fouts (00:18:27 - 00:18:50)
I did receive a call in the last two or three months from someone. I feel like she called it a bad time and I told her she could call later. I, I don't, I don't think we ever talked. But I did realize that it was a, it was a follow up call to figure out why we'd stopped using a Deja.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:50 - 00:18:52)
But it took them that long?
Kyle Fouts (00:18:54 - 00:18:55)
I would say yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:55 - 00:19:00)
Because you would have asked for a refund before that. Right. And that had processed.
Kyle Fouts (00:19:00 - 00:19:16)
Yes. Yeah. So I mean we had to cancel the accounts. I don't know. Maybe that's, maybe you could do that all through the self help online. I think, I think I was able to cancel. Cancel the. Or close the accounts just through the self help in the platform.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:19 - 00:19:22)
Do you get refunds otherwise or just when you canceled?
Kyle Fouts (00:19:24 - 00:19:31)
Just when we canceled just for the balance. Otherwise we, you know, we would have used up the money and had to refill the credits.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:31 - 00:19:36)
So does it just roll over in case it's not used? Like. I know you said per week, right?
Kyle Fouts (00:19:36 - 00:19:41)
Yeah, it exists. It stays on the, on the account until you use it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:42 - 00:19:46)
Okay, so it didn't register when you asked for a refund that you were canceling the account.
Kyle Fouts (00:19:46 - 00:19:56)
And I don't, I don't recall anyone offering us trying to get us to stay. I don't recall that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:57 - 00:20:10)
Sure. But even reaching out to say hey, are you canceling the account? You know, usually when you cancel, I mean, even if I cancel my Internet provider, they'll call me and say, hey, I'll offer you this. Please consider us or whatever.
Kyle Fouts (00:20:11 - 00:20:16)
Yeah, I don't think Indisha has that safe safety net in place.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:17 - 00:20:21)
And you would have been the person to call. Was there anybody else in your.
Kyle Fouts (00:20:21 - 00:20:23)
I mean, my, my contact information's on the account.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:23 - 00:20:45)
Oh, okay. So you, they would have contacted you. Yes, as the first point. Okay, most likely. All right. And going forward, if Indisha were to contact you, would you even entertain them? I mean, if somebody were to reach out and say, hey, you, would you reconsider or whatever, I'm not working again for indyc.
Kyle Fouts (00:20:45 - 00:20:51)
Yeah, I know, I know. I just, I don't think they could offer better rates than USPS directly because they have to make hypothetical.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:51 - 00:20:52)
Hypothetical.
Kyle Fouts (00:20:52 - 00:20:58)
Yeah, hypothetically, if they had better rates than usps, sure. It would be, it would not be a headache to switch back.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:59 - 00:21:05)
Okay. Just. I'm just trying to understand because you had a relationship with them to start with, so. Yeah.
Kyle Fouts (00:21:05 - 00:21:06)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:06 - 00:21:08)
Would that count at all if.
Kyle Fouts (00:21:08 - 00:21:10)
No, no, there's no relationship.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:11 - 00:21:23)
Okay, wait, but just business. I mean, if they were to offer you better rates, say, okay, I'll go with them. What I'm trying to understand is, would that be an easy switch? Because I know now you're happy with these people. So.
Kyle Fouts (00:21:24 - 00:21:41)
Yeah, if, if they were able to offer us better rates, we would probably switch. We would probably go back to USPS first and say, hey, we're getting better rates here. Can you, you know, improve our rates so we can stay with you?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:43 - 00:21:46)
So you go back to us. Yes. And ask them.
Kyle Fouts (00:21:46 - 00:21:47)
Yeah, absolutely.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:48 - 00:21:58)
Yeah. I mean, it's business when it comes down to it. Okay. Yeah, totally understandable. Okay. All right. Those are all my questions. Did you have anything else to add to this or.
Kyle Fouts (00:21:59 - 00:22:05)
I'm just curious about buried winds. I looked it up a little bit. It's. I guess you're a third party research firm.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:05 - 00:22:24)
Yeah. Based out of Austin and. Yeah. So we were just trying to. This is a client of ours and we're just trying to do some research for them, trying to understand, you know, what they could have done better or, or what they should, they should be doing different or, you know, any kind of experiences to report back, things like that.
Kyle Fouts (00:22:25 - 00:23:10)
Yeah, the. So whenever I got the message from like your automated system that said, let's see. So first, like the first message I got was last Friday and asked if I was interested and I replied yes and no. Response from your automated. I mean, I'm assuming it's an automated text service. So then on Tuesday, I got the message again and I replied yes. And then an hour later I got the calendly link. So is. Do you know if it's automated texting or if something.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:10 - 00:23:15)
It should be, but usually there's somebody to reply. I apologize. They should have been out to you.
Kyle Fouts (00:23:15 - 00:23:23)
I thought I. I didn't know how big the company was. I reached out to the. The CEO and told him that it was messed up. So he replied or the founder.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:23 - 00:23:23)
Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:23:24 - 00:23:25)
Was not working. Okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:25 - 00:23:40)
Yeah. Yeah. Calum Lee sometimes doesn't notify us in time saying that somebody has scheduled. So usually there's a. There's a little gap between, you know, when we get the message that you've accepted and then somebody reaches out to you. So I'm sorry about that again.
Kyle Fouts (00:23:40 - 00:23:41)
That's fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:41 - 00:23:50)
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up, but we know that there's an issue on our side. Then we'll get it fixed. Yeah. And is there anything else?
Kyle Fouts (00:23:51 - 00:23:52)
No, I don't think so.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:52 - 00:23:59)
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. I'm always happy to hear feedback as to, you know, how we can improve as well. So that's always a good thing. Yeah.
Kyle Fouts (00:23:59 - 00:24:00)
You guys use Salesforce?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:01 - 00:24:08)
I use Salesforce personally. I work for Birdwinds, but I also work as a Salesforce admin for another company, so.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:08 - 00:24:09)
Oh, cool.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:09 - 00:24:23)
I know the Salesforce platform. I'm trying to get my certification in the admin. The. But. Yeah, because I worked in the admin. But as an admin. I worked as a business analyst, but the problem is the Salesforce admin exam is a little. It's difficult. It's not easy.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:23 - 00:24:26)
So did you take the business analyst certification?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:26 - 00:24:27)
Yes.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:27 - 00:24:29)
That's what I want to do next.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:29 - 00:24:31)
Oh, that's going to be very easy if you're an admin.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:32 - 00:24:32)
Really?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:32 - 00:24:34)
I'm gonna have to study more. Yeah.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:34 - 00:24:36)
Should I study at all or just take it?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:36 - 00:24:40)
No, study just because you'll know what is the politically correct way of answering.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:40 - 00:24:45)
You know, I thought it was all like, like, you know, word. Word problems or whatever.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:46 - 00:24:52)
It's very easy. If you. If you've got the Salesforce admin cert, then the business analyst is a piece of cake.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:52 - 00:24:56)
I've got the admin and platform app builder.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:57 - 00:24:57)
Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:24:59 - 00:25:02)
But yeah, I set it as a goal this year to do the business analyst.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:02 - 00:25:16)
Just. Just go look over the material, you know, on Trailhead. Look over it for like, maybe a week. That should be enough. Just certain things, like, they have, like, drugless principles or something. Certain theory things that you should be aware of.
Kyle Fouts (00:25:16 - 00:25:17)
Okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:17 - 00:25:19)
But other than that, it's easy.
Kyle Fouts (00:25:20 - 00:25:23)
Have you been to any of the salesforce. Dreaming. Dreaming. Dreaming events?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:23 - 00:25:31)
No, I haven't. I want to go. There's, like. There's usually there in the west coast, like, as a floor or something. So I've never been there, but.
Kyle Fouts (00:25:31 - 00:25:42)
So they have. The regional ones. They're just called dreaming with no gn, Just an apostrophe. They had one in Atlanta last month.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:42 - 00:25:44)
Okay. No, they have.
Kyle Fouts (00:25:44 - 00:25:59)
They have one in. They have one in Florida. The one in Atlanta is moving. That was the last year that it was there. I think they had it there like eight or nine years, and it's moving. And some people think it might move to, like, North Carolina so they'd be closer to you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:00 - 00:26:23)
Yeah, well, North Carolina, the. The sort of. The salesforce community, if you will. For me, the closest will be Charlotte, and the closest. The biggest one is more Virginia, D.C. that area. So Atlanta is actually closer to me, and the community is pretty big there. The salesforce community is huge there.
Kyle Fouts (00:26:25 - 00:26:26)
How far are you from Atlanta?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:27 - 00:26:28)
About two and a half hours.
Kyle Fouts (00:26:28 - 00:26:30)
Okay. How far from Charlotte?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:31 - 00:26:31)
An hour.
Kyle Fouts (00:26:32 - 00:26:32)
Oh, okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:32 - 00:26:34)
I'm in Colombia, so it's like, right in the middle.
Kyle Fouts (00:26:35 - 00:26:42)
Yeah. We've got a guy, he was working in the office in Atlanta, and then he moved to South Carolina.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:42 - 00:26:44)
Oh, where in South Carolina?
Kyle Fouts (00:26:44 - 00:26:52)
I don't know, but he drives to work like, once a week, and then he stays the night. So he's in the office two days?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:53 - 00:27:01)
Yeah, yeah. It's. It's. You can drive back, but it's. It's. It's easier if you just stay overnight when you go to lion, but it might be.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:01 - 00:27:03)
It might be Columbia. His wife's like a nurse or something, so.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:04 - 00:27:04)
Okay.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:04 - 00:27:05)
All right.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:06 - 00:27:06)
Interesting.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:07 - 00:27:08)
Cool. What was your name?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:09 - 00:27:10)
Nandini.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:10 - 00:27:11)
Nandini. Nice to meet you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:12 - 00:27:14)
Same here. And all the best if you're taking the B exam.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:15 - 00:27:19)
Yeah. Thank you. And when do I get the. The money for this interview?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:20 - 00:27:41)
Within 48 hours. Somebody should be reaching out to you. If they don't, please reach out. Because, you know, sometimes it goes to a wrong address or something like that. The message, not the money, that. That will be for sure. So make sure you contact them if it doesn't reach you. But it should. You don't have an issue with the payments, so.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:41 - 00:27:42)
Cool.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:42 - 00:27:42)
All right.
Kyle Fouts (00:27:42 - 00:27:45)
All right. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:45 - 00:27:46)
You too. Bye. Bye.
",,8/12/2025 9:26am,"Endicia Churn Discussion Guide V1
Common Desired Learnings Across Stakeholders
1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

Raw Transcript:

Kevin Murphy (00:03:24 - 00:03:49)
It's.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:16 - 00:07:17)
Kevin. Kevin.
Kevin Murphy (00:07:17 - 00:07:18)
How are you doing today?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:18 - 00:07:20)
I'm good, thank you. How are you?
Kevin Murphy (00:07:20 - 00:07:20)
Good.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:23 - 00:07:40)
Well, thank you so much for coming. My name is Nandini. I'm with B.O. we're a third party research firm working with Indicia with some key clients to understand their experiences. So thank you so much for sparing the time to talk with me.
Kevin Murphy (00:07:40 - 00:07:41)
Absolutely.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:41 - 00:07:47)
Sure. Before we get started, just want to let you know that this is being recorded. Is that okay with you?
Kevin Murphy (00:07:47 - 00:07:48)
Yep, that's fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:48 - 00:07:55)
Okay, so tell me something about yourself, your company. What do you do?
Kevin Murphy (00:07:56 - 00:09:23)
So I'm a transportation manager for two of our divisions. We are a pet healthcare company. So the division I do is prescriptions and things to the pets. So if you think of it, you go to a vet and your pet has a prescription, like on a monthly thing. What we do is to fill those prescriptions and mail them directly to the customer's houses. So you don't necessarily have to go to the vet every month. So kind of like the subscription things. We support the vets in what they're doing. So not necessarily like a direct e comm kind of place. You have to kind of go through your vet and you have to go through get prescriptions and things. So we focus mainly on the healthcare of the pets and not necessarily on, say, toys or other products like that. So my division is like the smaller vet in home. We also have an equine division as well, which is horses and large animal. And then those two divisions I just talked about were on stamps for a very long time. As I know it's not the exact same thing as Indisha, but it is kind of like the half or slash Indisha. And then the other division is different though. So those two I had mentioned are like B2C. Neither one is B2B and those are ordered today, delivered tomorrow directly to clinics and hospitals and things like that for pets. So that's a different animal and they have not been on stamps or Indonesia before.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:25 - 00:09:37)
I see. So you deliver directly to customers. You do okay. Yeah. My pet uses the Simperico Trio. He's a golden. You probably play a part there.
Kevin Murphy (00:09:37 - 00:09:41)
Yep. It's very convenient when it comes to you so you don't have to keep running up for it, right?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:41 - 00:09:44)
Yeah, yeah. We just get it delivered once in six months.
Kevin Murphy (00:09:44 - 00:09:45)
Yeah. Yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:47 - 00:09:54)
All right, coming back. So I understand that you, you have been using Indicia for some time, correct?
Kevin Murphy (00:09:55 - 00:09:57)
We have, but we've moved away from them now.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:57 - 00:10:00)
Sure. So how long did you use it before you moved away?
Kevin Murphy (00:10:00 - 00:10:10)
At least at Least seven years that I know of. And I think it went back further than that, but that was the furthest I could find back in the record. So I've been with the company for about three.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:11 - 00:10:13)
Okay, okay.
Kevin Murphy (00:10:13 - 00:10:23)
And we used them mainly up through one division was through about August of last year and then the other one was through January of this year.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:25 - 00:10:32)
Oh, okay, okay. And so have you reduced using or completely stopped using them?
Kevin Murphy (00:10:32 - 00:10:35)
We've moved away now entirely.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:36 - 00:10:39)
And what prompted this? I mean.
Kevin Murphy (00:10:40 - 00:12:09)
Well, part of it was, I mean we had a great business working relationship with it. So we understood that when regulations changed they could no longer offer the discounted prices, you know, all the resell or reshuffling there. So we were, we understood that and we were still very much engaged with their system. But our issue ran into more of. With the reserve account, the reserve postage account with the company where we would put cash in to pre fund our accounts in an enterpriser way. It was the lack of visibility and then the lack of accounting coming out of that. So we were putting cash in and we like, okay, but I couldn't get a real balance of what was it. You know, I knew how much I was putting in, I can see how much it's going out. But we, the information we were getting automated to us was also very off. And what I mean, off it was like close off, like $600,000 off. So I'm like, I can't give that to my accounting team. They want pennies, of course. So I mean we did try to work through that quite a bit, but it really came down to the visibility and then that part of the trust thing, I'm like, you know, because we are giving you cash directly into that account. It was just that visibility. And I understand, I don't know if indecision or stamps have direct control over the postage reserve accounts that are set to them, but I know that that is separate from the regular accounting or finance team.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:10 - 00:12:21)
So, so help me understand how this process works because so do they. Do you put in like a certain amount every week or every month? Like, like, like a deposit?
Kevin Murphy (00:12:21 - 00:12:48)
Yeah. So it's so in. So unlike the UPS or FedEx or other carriers, they'll invoice you after you've delivered. With the post office, it's a prepay model, so you have to pay up front or have funds available for when the label's made. So you have to keep funds in that account. If it runs out, then you can't make any labels. So you actually have to make sure you keep Cash sitting in there. So you're able to process.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:49 - 00:12:50)
And that is through Andisha.
Kevin Murphy (00:12:51 - 00:13:44)
Yes. So there's a postage reserve account for enterprise customers. Way back when it used to be on a credit card. We had it on a credit card, even a large company for us, we. I don't know why, but we were still using our credit card and it would just auto fund, you know, ever so much and it worked fine. But then there were some regulation changes around that it could no longer be a credit card and it had to be an ACH bank account or the trust account. Our finance did not want to do at ACH because they don't want to try to reconcile thousands of lines of transactions coming out. You know, each time it tried to do these credits or also the taking the information out of the account itself. So that's when we moved forward with the trust account. So then you can still see what's coming out and it still does increments by the day, not necessarily transactional. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:45 - 00:13:51)
So the ACH works like kind of like a PayPal, like through a different provider, and so you can hook it.
Kevin Murphy (00:13:51 - 00:14:00)
Up directly to your ACH account. So then each time you're doing a manifest or whatever, it would come out at the end of each day for each location.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:01 - 00:14:01)
Okay.
Kevin Murphy (00:14:01 - 00:14:04)
You would have to reconcile. So we have quite a few locations.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:05 - 00:14:15)
Okay. And so doesn't that money. Suppose you. You put in X amount of money per week and so whatever is left over, doesn't it just roll over to the next week?
Kevin Murphy (00:14:15 - 00:14:39)
Yes. So that. Yes. So it just stays there until you're using it. But our issue was that we had no visibility to exactly how much money was sitting there. So as you're trying to plan for like forecast or volume increases or a sale coming up, it's like, okay, how much do I need to add to that account to make sure we have enough funds so it doesn't run to zero, so we don't stop the business, you know, that kind of thing. So it was just.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:39 - 00:14:41)
Isn't there like a set amount that you have to put in every week?
Kevin Murphy (00:14:42 - 00:15:14)
No. So that you determine how much you're putting in there. Yeah. But, you know, we would try to keep about two and a half weeks at least. Or not two and a half. Yeah, two and a half weeks at least operating in there in case there was an issue with some of the transfers or we need to do an immediate wire transfer or something like that. But at times, you know, that would balloon up. So we would have like a million dollars in cash sitting in that account at times. So it's like, it's hard to justify that with your finance people.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:15 - 00:15:33)
I can see that. And so, so tell me something. Did anybody. Did you try to reach out to them to say, hey, you know, can we know, can we understand how much is there in the account so I can do something about it? Or did they reach out to you, anything like that?
Kevin Murphy (00:15:34 - 00:16:49)
Are we. Yes, I worked with them for about eight and a half to nine months going through the process of trying to do that. And also at one point we asked them, will you please stop the automated emails that are coming out? Because they have very incorrect information at times. And sometimes it would say it was a negative balance because it was just how their system accounted for like invoicing and then how it took things out of that account and moved it to Indisha or to stamps. Because I think what they did is that in their accounting, then they moved money to them, you know, as part of that process to cover. So I think the labels were technically coming out of Indechiner stamps accounts and then they moved the cash from those postage reserve accounts to them. So yeah, it was complicated. It was just like it was just did not have any visibility after we went into this process. So it was. But yes, we went through eight and a half, nine months trying to go through that. Just very incorrect information and not able to get it done. And they. And you couldn't call support on that by the way either. So the support people did not have access or visibility to the postage reserve. So they couldn't tell you how much was in there.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:50 - 00:16:53)
Do you have like any account manager or somebody in charge of your account?
Kevin Murphy (00:16:54 - 00:17:27)
Oh yeah, we definitely had account managers. That was part of our. Our thing too is there was a few changes with the people. As with any company, you know, we get new account reps. Some are better than others and some are, you know, you know, been around for a while and others are just learning the ropes. But yeah, like I said, we still liked working with stamps for so many years. They're a great partner. We liked that they were carrier agnostic. We needed something a little different and have more visibility on the financial side.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:28 - 00:17:30)
Is stamps integrated with Indonesia?
Kevin Murphy (00:17:30 - 00:18:01)
Yes, they're the same, in fact, trying to think who bought whom. They're all integrated. And in fact, the equine division in their wms, they couldn't get the stamps module to work for the USPS module, so they actually used the direct Indisha model module in their system. So, you know, like we had one business logging into stamps to get their information, you know. And then we had one logging into Adisha. It was they're all the exact same.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:01 - 00:18:10)
Accounts and yeah, that's good. So what do you use now now that you've gone away from indicia?
Kevin Murphy (00:18:10 - 00:18:19)
So we negotiated a contract directly with the post office. So we're on a contract now with them with the negotiated rates with usps.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:21 - 00:18:23)
Okay. Did they give you better rates?
Kevin Murphy (00:18:23 - 00:18:24)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:25 - 00:18:32)
And what about the other issues? Like you said, transparency and you know, putting that money reserve and account manager everything. How does that.
Kevin Murphy (00:18:32 - 00:18:59)
So yeah, just like. Well, you know, it's the same regulation. So yes, there is a. We have for them, it's now called an EPS trust account. It's their version of the exact same thing. But we actually can see real time, what's the balance. And it also has an export function so we can see by meter and by location how each one of them spending each day. So we can also use that for accounting and breakout by our facilities or divisions.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:59 - 00:19:01)
So if you want to pull a report on that, can you do that?
Kevin Murphy (00:19:02 - 00:19:03)
Yep. Real time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:05 - 00:19:10)
That's cool. Okay. And do you have somebody in charge of your business, an account manager?
Kevin Murphy (00:19:12 - 00:19:23)
Yes. So it's similar to what we had with stamps or Indisha. We have an account manager, we have a BSA manager and a technical manager usually assigning to our accounts.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:24 - 00:19:26)
And how long have you been with usps?
Kevin Murphy (00:19:27 - 00:19:28)
Since August last year.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:28 - 00:19:37)
A year now. Okay. And have you had issues with them ever that you had to reach out and just your experience over the last year?
Kevin Murphy (00:19:38 - 00:20:18)
Oh, actually it's been phenomenal. I've also been around the block, if you can tell. I'm not really that young. I've also worked very closely with carriers and different companies through the years. So I also have a very long working relationship with the post office and things since I'm also familiar with a lot of how their systems and things work too. I usually can ask pretty direct questions. I'm not sure if everyone gets the same, you know, experience or response, but we actually get a very good response from them and have monthly meetings with them. We have several projects going on with them when a new initiative that they're rolling out. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:21 - 00:20:31)
But have you, have you ever had like an issue that you had to reach out to support and you got the support that you wanted? I think you're going on mute.
Kevin Murphy (00:20:33 - 00:20:33)
Now. I can.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:34 - 00:20:36)
Yeah, that's better.
Kevin Murphy (00:20:36 - 00:20:36)
I can hear you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:36 - 00:20:37)
I thought it was.
Kevin Murphy (00:20:37 - 00:20:38)
I couldn't hear you for a second.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:38 - 00:20:57)
Okay. Yeah. So did you have any in the last year that You've used them. I know that you said you know their processes and everything, but did you ever have to reach out with any issue, any, any kind of, even a small one? And what happened then? Did you get the support you needed? How fast was it? How slow, whatever.
Kevin Murphy (00:20:58 - 00:21:35)
Yeah, so we do get the support. So if it's an issue with a pickup or an issue with. I'm also seeing a delay in certain areas, we have them reach out to the local hubs to see if they're just behind or if we need to reroute packages to a different area or ship, you know. Also if we know if there's area problems in an area, you know, like say one service, we're like, well, we can push it to an air service because we know that'll go to another hub. But we did the exact same things with stamps too. So we would work with the post office directly to see where there were delays in networks to help route packages and shift volume around.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:35 - 00:21:47)
Sure. No, I was just trying to see how responsive they were as compared to. I know you said, Indisha, you went eight months back and forth and back and forth. How were issues resolved here? Was it better?
Kevin Murphy (00:21:48 - 00:22:04)
Oh yeah. So they're very quick. I think. I've emailed our account rep back and forth about four or five times already this week, you know, on a couple things. So it's. They're very responsive on getting things to us. But like I said, I don't know if that's everyone's experience, but it happens to be ours.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:06 - 00:22:09)
Well, good for you. You got lucky.
Kevin Murphy (00:22:09 - 00:22:10)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:10 - 00:22:28)
I just think that, you know, you worked well with them so that it's, it's on both sides that it worked out well. So. Yeah, I'm happy for you for that. So do you. Before, I know you said last year. Right. So before you went with usps, did you consider anybody else. Do you consider other providers?
Kevin Murphy (00:22:33 - 00:23:18)
I looked at other carriers but we needed someone to be able to handle the volume and then the size of our package. Even like when we were going with stamps, you know, a large segment, you know, like the super majority of the volume is what's going, you know, first class mail at the time, you know, with this during, through the stamps label. So it's very ultralight packages. Because you think it's that Supergo trio that you mentioned, it's really small coming to you. So you're talking like one to four ounces. So they're this lightweight packages. It's not necessarily. We wouldn't want to shift something like that. To say all one of the other carriers like a FedEx or UPS, because their pricing all starts at like one pound.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:19 - 00:23:19)
Yeah.
Kevin Murphy (00:23:19 - 00:23:32)
Whereas, you know, if you keep it within the postal network, it's now, now four ounce buckets. But it used to be one ounce buckets, you know, so it's just a, it's a different price point and a different service. You know, just trying to match that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:34 - 00:23:45)
Do you have large packages? Because I'm just trying to understand pet pens. I'm like, how large can the package be? Do you often have like large packages to ship?
Kevin Murphy (00:23:45 - 00:24:06)
Well, so depending on our divisions, we have like ultra lightweight packages. We have very small. But we also have big packages too, because remember, we do have an equine division and part of our others is that we have diet foods or dog foods. Like those 5, 10 or 25 pound bags of food. Oh yeah, we have all sizes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:06 - 00:24:10)
I can measure the size of that bag. I see you shipped that also. Okay.
Kevin Murphy (00:24:10 - 00:24:11)
Yep, yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:13 - 00:24:22)
And whose decision was this to go with usps? Did you decide or combination of people sat together and decided. How did you focus on this?
Kevin Murphy (00:24:25 - 00:24:42)
I put the business proposal together and then negotiated the contract with usps. It took about a year and a half to negotiate and go back and forth, be transparent on the volume. And then after I put the business proposal, our senior leadership then signed off on making a change like that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:42 - 00:24:45)
But it was primarily your decision, correct?
Kevin Murphy (00:24:45 - 00:24:46)
Correct, yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:46 - 00:24:49)
Okay. Yeah, I was trying to understand that.
Kevin Murphy (00:24:49 - 00:25:22)
And for, you know, for our customers too, you know, there was, it was more also a continuity of service because whether it was a label from stamps or a label from usps, it's still being delivered by the post office and it's the same carriers, the same. So there was no, there was no like disruption to our customers also going that route. Whereas if we would have changed to a different carrier, like a, like a DHL or some of the others out there, or even sometimes at Pitney Bow, since they get routed a little differently, then our customers may see more of that transition.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:23 - 00:25:24)
Would it have made a difference to them?
Kevin Murphy (00:25:26 - 00:25:31)
You would be surprised. People are very passionate about their pets.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:31 - 00:25:39)
Oh yeah, of course. I think, I think also the element of suspicion maybe like who's this coming from? Yeah, medication that I'm feeding my.
Kevin Murphy (00:25:39 - 00:25:39)
Right.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:39 - 00:25:43)
My boyfriend, my baby. Yeah, I know. Yeah, of course.
Kevin Murphy (00:25:43 - 00:25:56)
Yeah. Because we know we also looked at some like 3 PL services or some of the other regional carriers. But you know, since some of these are like prescriptions, you know, we didn't want people necessarily arriving in non marked Vehicles dropping off packages.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:57 - 00:25:59)
That's a whole trust element to it too.
Kevin Murphy (00:26:00 - 00:26:00)
Yep, yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:01 - 00:26:31)
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand that completely. I wouldn't give my pet something from an and prime is doing that a lot nowadays. You know, they come in these unmarked van, like who's this, you know, coming to my doorstep? Yeah, no, I understand that. Okay. All right. And what do you think are the key maybe strengths of usps, like three things that stand out or things that you've been really happy with over the last year?
Kevin Murphy (00:26:34 - 00:27:48)
Well, they're actually doing a lot of change. You don't usually hear those words together, USPS and change. But over the last two years they really have gotten rid of several classes of mail, merged them together, change their sortations and networks and now they're rolling out new services and increasing transit in a lot of the ground transit areas, which is mainly, you know, what we were using them for is those ground transits as ultra lightweight packages. So they have made, I would say, a transformation at least from that standpoint in the sense that the areas they're covering in the time is actually coming down for where we deliver compared to our buildings. So it's a better experience for our customer and why that's good for us as the customers then also can easily go to their tracking or see the package coming in like that informed delivery if they get the email themselves too, so they can see the package is on the way or also the links that we're sending to them. It's more that just continuing that that trust factor is that, you know, the USPS is going to always try to get it to you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:49 - 00:28:05)
Yeah. In fact we usually get a text message saying hey, it's coming in the next two hours or whatever. Yeah, okay. Okay. So have they like streamlined things for you? I mean because you said of all the changes that they're going through. Okay, okay.
Kevin Murphy (00:28:05 - 00:28:41)
And then you know, when we have like had an issue or something, we also try to be very responsible. So I think at the one time we had an issue with one of our labels we were making with stamps that wasn't compliant and it wasn't necessarily a stamps issue or maybe it was a UPS connect ship issue. It was one of the two is that we couldn't get the right type of label to be printed for the product we needed. You know, so some of those medications do need to have certain shipping restrictions on them and a different label, but we couldn't produce what we needed to there. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:43 - 00:28:59)
Okay. And when you decided to move, I mean, did you like go Cancel the account. How did you, how did you deal with Indicia at that point? Did you cancel the account? Did you demand a refund? Or did you give them any indication that you were leaving them and maybe.
Kevin Murphy (00:28:59 - 00:30:18)
Oh yeah, yeah, because like I said, we at least had like a long working relationship. They were a good business partner, especially the people we interacted with every day. We did let them know that, you know, we were going to be making a change. And then what we did is we started to just draw down the balance that we thought was in that account so we could, you know, just don't have cash sitting there at the end. And then we were slowly doing it in ways building by building, you know, as we would do the conversion, you know, so we could do it in a more of a controlled banner and then just understand. So then after would be the wind down of that, the last day ship, you have to wait, you know, seven to 10 days, just make sure nothing else is moving, try to reduce credits and then start closing the meters. Once you go close the meters, it's about 30 to 90 days before you get the credit back for that. Then after all the meters are closed, then you can finally close the postage reserve account for that as well. So that wind down process took another nine to 10 months of total, probably. Yeah. And then that was for one division and I had to do the same thing for another division as well. But luckily it was only one location at that time for that one. But it was still, it's still a very long wind down process then.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:19 - 00:30:25)
So were you satisfied with the refund that you got? I mean, did it coincide with the amount that you thought should be?
Kevin Murphy (00:30:27 - 00:31:21)
Yes. So you know, like I said, we kept, we try to keep very engaged with them throughout the process. So it was like, you know, I mean, I'm also the type person, I keep a very detailed records of things. So you know, sometimes they came back with amounts, like here's the amount you owe. And I'm like, we don't owe that. Here is the list of products that we put in and here's the things that came out. There's no way we owe that, you know, that kind of thing. So. And I did have many screen shares with some of their accounting managers as well as we went through that. Like, okay, show me how you got to your number, you know, and then it'd be like, okay, we don't see those deposits. Did you get those deposits? They came out of our account. Did you put them in? You know, recognize that they came from our account? And put them into our account. And so it was. It was not a whole forensic thing, but we did get very detailed at any time. There was exceptions.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:22 - 00:31:27)
Okay. And this level of responsiveness, was it after you decided to close the account or was it.
Kevin Murphy (00:31:29 - 00:31:31)
Unfortunately, yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:33 - 00:31:36)
That'S what I was hearing from you, but I wanted that confirmation.
Kevin Murphy (00:31:36 - 00:32:01)
Yes. And that's the other thing, too. They also were going through a new invoicing program or, you know, as well, so it was all new to them. And some of their invoice or accounting programs weren't talking to each other. So they're getting, you know, so I understand that they were moving a lot of their customers and things like that, but it was just, it wasn't necessarily. It didn't remain a good fit for us at the time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:02 - 00:32:07)
So that was more their internal company, you know, doing some kind of change. Okay.
Kevin Murphy (00:32:07 - 00:32:24)
And I think that's also, like, to the point where we were talking earlier is it's the umbrella of companies. So in their accounting and invoicing, those were merging into other, you know, into one to do, like, more of a single invoicing kind of thing. So at least that's how it was explained to me or the reason they were given.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:27 - 00:32:33)
Yeah. And did they ever try to get your business back once they knew that you were trying to move away?
Kevin Murphy (00:32:37 - 00:33:29)
No, but there's also not a large incentive for them to do that anymore. So before, they would have had a large incentive when they were doing a reseller. So if they could do that 3% markup, you know, and then just kind of like sell us the labels directly, that kind of thing, then they're making money, you know, off of that. But really also, they would be making money from a larger account like us is just a monthly subscription fee, you know, for like an enterprise. So you talk about $149 a month. It's not. It wouldn't be a large amount that they would be getting for us, at least in what we were using them for. Maybe if we were engaged in other services or other pieces, you know, it makes more sense, but it just wouldn't be a large money maker for them to help. Help with their bottom line either.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:31 - 00:33:39)
Okay, but they were responsive to you when they found out that you were leaving, and you know that. So I'm guessing they would still be interested in your business.
Kevin Murphy (00:33:40 - 00:33:40)
The. Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:41 - 00:33:50)
Okay. All right. So did you know. And so other than USPS, do you use anybody else, like UPS or FedEx or anything else?
Kevin Murphy (00:33:51 - 00:34:13)
Well, you use, you know, USPS, UPS, FedEx, we have some other regional carriers as well, but those are much smaller percentages, you know, so it. But we. For the, the prescription one, the one like sends to your pet, it's just we only went have the two carriers, USPS and UPS.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:13 - 00:34:15)
Okay, and what do you use FedEx for?
Kevin Murphy (00:34:15 - 00:34:16)
Why?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:16 - 00:34:19)
I mean, why do you use multiple. Is it just volume or.
Kevin Murphy (00:34:20 - 00:35:02)
It's not necessarily volume, it's performance. So all carriers are doing different things right now to try to save money. So some carriers are also speeding up areas, but others are also slowing areas down or no longer delivering to every zip. So if we have, you know, like the one business we have order today, delivered tomorrow to the hospital. So if one carrier does not deliver that day, you know, we would push it to the carrier. That would, you know, kind of thing. So because, you know, if it's going to an animal hospital for surgeries and things that they need the product on that day, they can't wait for the next day, you know, because that'll be after the surgery kind of thing.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:02 - 00:35:19)
Oh, so last minute can you do that? Like if somebody is like if there's a big surgery happening in a hospital and say it's a holiday or something like that, or thanks, you know, the day before or something. USPS is not doing it. Can you suddenly, like, because you have an account with FedEx, call them up and they would deliver? Does that work that way?
Kevin Murphy (00:35:19 - 00:35:22)
Well, we can make the label for the FedEx or.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:22 - 00:35:23)
And they would pick it up. Okay.
Kevin Murphy (00:35:23 - 00:35:25)
Yep, yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:25 - 00:35:32)
So that's more for like last minute and emergencies and things like that and places where USPS doesn't deliver, things like that.
Kevin Murphy (00:35:32 - 00:36:15)
Yeah, yeah. So we try to keep, you know, active accounts and we keep good working relationships with all of the carriers we use. But then also the carriers we don't necessarily use. So just because we're not necessarily using like a DHL or something else like that, we remain engaged with them because with any business it's constantly changing. So it's good to have good working relationships with these other companies as well. So if something changes, you know, we can bring them back. That's the same thing we were doing with Stamps and Adisha too. You know, hey, it wasn't a great fit right now. But if things change and things, you know, we would always be open to the possibility of also coming back as well. Well, so it's just we want to make sure that we're being a good business partner and you know, so if.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:36:15 - 00:36:24)
Things changed and they sort of, you know, made everything right that you found was messy. Do you think you would entertain them again? Do you think you'd be open to them coming back?
Kevin Murphy (00:36:25 - 00:36:27)
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:36:28 - 00:36:45)
Okay. What would it take? I mean just if you were to just state three things, what would it take for you to get them back? I mean if they were interested in your business, I know you said they probably wouldn't, it wouldn't be a big difference to them and all of that. But if they were really interested, what would you want them to do?
Kevin Murphy (00:36:48 - 00:37:46)
We would. Well, in the current arrow obviously it would have to be one is price point, you know, what type of rates and things are they offering. But then it's also then the other we already know we can connect to their system just fine because we, we left all that integration work in place. We didn't take any of that out. So we leave things active unless something changes, like a complete system overhaul or something. But we keep our integrations and label certifications current in case that we ever do switch back and have that as an option. But mainly we bump price point and then it would be about, we'd have to have good transparency and where we had the issue was more around the financial reporting piece. So you know, just because I want to move them back to that point and you also would need to make sure my financial business partners are comfortable doing this and like, okay, we're going to move this cash over here. Are you comfortable doing that, you know, kind of thing.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:37:46 - 00:38:03)
Accounts has to be happy with that. The accounting department has to be happy as well. Did you know of Indicia having any affiliation with shipstation? It's a multi carrier solution. Did you know about that?
Kevin Murphy (00:38:05 - 00:38:15)
There are so many out there. They have a lot in their umbrella. I didn't know if it was shipit or shipstation. Is there an easy print too that's also under their umbrella?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:38:16 - 00:38:17)
I have no idea.
Kevin Murphy (00:38:17 - 00:38:25)
Yeah, that's why. But they're all like, they're different applications of the same thing and I think they're just marketed differently. But. Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:38:26 - 00:38:37)
Yeah, I think ShipStation API is like the overall and then ndash. Yeah. Okay. So did you ever consider them? Because just because you use multiple providers, that's all that's, that's what I'm asking.
Kevin Murphy (00:38:41 - 00:38:55)
We did not. And it's mainly because the, the one that we are using currently we have a TMS system that we're running through to help determine what the carrier that we'll choose for its things. So we have business rule logic.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:38:56 - 00:38:59)
Okay, I'm sorry, what is a TMS system?
Kevin Murphy (00:38:59 - 00:40:05)
So it's a, it's like a transportation management system. Okay. So we're pushing all the orders and we can then determine how to ship something whether it's. We want to focus on speed or cost point or weight. And it's very granular to the zip code and different flags for different types of orders and things like that going through. So we make sure that we can then adhere to any shipping regulations that are coming through by the items that are in the box. But then also, you know, as you can know, there's like 12 ways you can ship something and they're all different price points. It's like if five of them are the same transit time, you kind of go for the, what is the lower price point or the one that you think is consistent too. You don't want necessarily always want the lowest. You want what's the consistent one to our customers. So that pet parent gets the package when they say they're going to get it, you know, and we don't want to choose the cheapest option and then it misses the delivery times and then the pet parents calling our customer service agents looking for that package. So we want to make sure that we're delivering that consistent message.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:40:06 - 00:40:11)
Did that happen with Indicia ever? Like they. Yeah, that's why.
Kevin Murphy (00:40:11 - 00:40:33)
So that's the thing is that's why we kept with like from Indisha to usps because it's, it's literally the same carrier. It was just who was making the label label. So we didn't change anything there. So it's, it was the same. So, you know, if it was good in one, it's still good in the other. If it's bad and one, it's still bad in the other, at least for that part.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:40:34 - 00:40:56)
Okay. Just going back a step, I know you said you were able to pull because financials was a big thing for you, the transparency. Right? Yeah. I promise I won't take more than five minutes of your time, but you're fine. So when you. With Indicia, were you able to pull any reports like financially to see, you know, what is the spending over like a week or a month or anything like that.
Kevin Murphy (00:40:58 - 00:41:11)
So label print labels that were printed. Yes. We would get a weekly report from them so we could see the labels printed, but we would not get a financial report of what was in that postage reserve account.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:41:11 - 00:41:14)
Okay. And that would have made a difference to you.
Kevin Murphy (00:41:14 - 00:41:14)
Right.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:41:15 - 00:41:23)
If you were able to see that. Okay. And see, I know you wanted to predict like for two weeks or forecast for like, you know, how much would be needed going forward.
Kevin Murphy (00:41:23 - 00:42:00)
Yep, yep. Because so, so just internally we, I sent an email every week to our treasury department to then put in a specified amount into those trust accounts to make sure that we stay pre funded. So it's like, how do we determine how much we need in there? But also we need to keep enough in there in case one carrier network goes down. So maybe UPS doesn't accept packages for a certain day or they're closed for a holiday and then we would need to move the volume like we said to the other carrier. So we want to have that ability or enough money sitting in there to also be able to do that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:42:00 - 00:42:10)
So how are you managing? I'm curious because if I don't know how much money is still there, how much more do I put in? How are you managing even well now.
Kevin Murphy (00:42:10 - 00:42:17)
Today I have a real time visibility so I can see how much is sitting in there and then how much is coming out.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:42:17 - 00:42:21)
Oh, yes, for sure now. But with an issue when you didn't know. How are you managing?
Kevin Murphy (00:42:21 - 00:42:25)
I was just going off of math. I knew how much I was putting in and I could see how much I was.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:42:25 - 00:42:31)
So you were maintaining that account on your side to see approximately this would be a month. Yeah, that would have been time.
Kevin Murphy (00:42:31 - 00:42:41)
Nothing new. When it comes to like month end or you know, quarter end reporting with our finance team, it was like, well, here's the numbers I have. And they're like, well, what does the vendor say?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:42:43 - 00:42:47)
And was there ever a situation when your math did not coincide with their math?
Kevin Murphy (00:42:48 - 00:42:48)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:42:49 - 00:42:55)
Okay. Does that happen often when they said, no, hey, you don't have that money sitting there that you claim that you have?
Kevin Murphy (00:42:55 - 00:43:28)
Well, that's when I would reach out to our AP team and then they would pull me the, like the NetSuite or the ACH deposit transfers. Then I would provide stamps or indicia the list. Here's the deposit transfers. Can you make sure that those were put into the right account? You know, because sometimes they would go into like a general fund account and not necessarily get assigned to our account. So they'd be like, here are the ones that were specific to ours. We'll make sure that those are in our account. There's a lot of detail oriented things to do on the fly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:43:30 - 00:43:52)
It's a lot if you have to sit and do it all on your end. Yeah. Okay, so if somebody from indicia would reach out and you know, tell you that, hey, we'll look after this part. Are you still willing to work with us? Do you think you, you Might give it a try going forward. As long as their rates are, you know, good for you or equal to what USPS is offering.
Kevin Murphy (00:43:53 - 00:44:34)
Yeah, and like I said, I think they're still a great service. The good thing with stamps or indicia, is there a carrier agnostic. So, you know, we're talking mainly about USPS because that's how we use them. But I know they also have other carriers and services inside their portfolio. So once you're hooked into those modules when you're printing, you could also choose in the ship, you know, with them as well, so. Absolutely. I think they're a great company. You know, I would love to keep up to date on like what their, what they're rolling out, how they're making things better, how they're doing, you know, that kind of thing. And then like I said, if it's a good fit, then you know, definitely entertain, you know, bringing them back at some point.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:44:35 - 00:44:58)
So even if you don't work with them, I know you have, you work with USPS now, would you still like to hear like maybe from them saying, hey, these are some things new that we've got, you know, just, just keep it on your radar so that next time you're looking for somebody, would you be open to that? Okay. Yes, it would. Okay. So how long is your contract with usps? I mean, when is the next time that you're going to look for somebody or consider, you know, even renewing their contract?
Kevin Murphy (00:45:00 - 00:45:16)
Well, it's a, the standard, I think it's a three year discounted rate contract, but there's no financial penalty if you discontinue it. So it's just a discounted rate a contract. It's not like a volume specific contract or financial penalty.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:45:17 - 00:45:34)
Okay. Okay. All right, Well, I don't have any other questions. Okay, so you should be getting your payment within the next 48 hours for this interview. In case there's any issue. Please reach out and we'll make sure that that's solved.
Kevin Murphy (00:45:34 - 00:45:40)
Okay, thank you. Yeah. If you have any other follow up questions or need me to answer anything, just let me know. Happy to help.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:45:40 - 00:45:42)
I will do so. Thank you so much.
Kevin Murphy (00:45:42 - 00:45:43)
Okay, thank you. Have a good day.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:45:43 - 00:45:44)

",,8/12/2025 9:25am,"Endicia Churn Discussion Guide V1
Common Desired Learnings Across Stakeholders
1. Churn Drivers: Understand why customers reduce or stop using Endicia, focusing on shifts to USPS direct API, competitor offerings, or other carriers, and the role of pricing, service, or technology (Candi, 00:06:22-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:08:53-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Competitor Strategies: Gain insights into USPS’s direct API tactics, including pricing incentives, revenue sharing, and sales approaches, as well as competitors’ offerings like ProShip or other partners moving to USPS direct (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:08:13-00:08:46).
3. Value of Multi-Carrier Solutions: Determine what would entice customers to shift volume to Endicia or adopt ShipStation API, especially for multi-homing customers or those using tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:14:45-00:15:34).
4. Customer Experience Post-Migration: Explore pain points and benefits customers experience after moving to USPS API or other solutions compared to Endicia (Chris S, 00:13:29-00:14:25; Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39).
5. Multi-Homing Behavior: Investigate why customers split their shipping volume across multiple providers and what it would take to consolidate more volume with Endicia or ShipStation API (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:16).
6. Decision-Making Influencers: Identify key decision-makers and influencers within customer organizations who may not have been effectively engaged by Endicia (Chris S, 00:14:27-00:15:34; Anthony, 00:20:13-00:20:55).
7. Barriers to Transition: Explore specific challenges preventing customers from moving to ShipStation API, such as tech partner limitations, development costs, or lack of perceived value (Candi, 00:15:34-00:17:39; Anthony, 00:25:32-00:26:23).
8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).

It's, it's.
Chris Jenkins (00:07:54 - 00:07:55)
Good morning, how are you?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:56 - 00:07:58)
Good morning. I'm good, thank you. How are you?
Chris Jenkins (00:07:58 - 00:07:59)
Not too bad.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:01 - 00:08:02)
Thank you for joining us today.
Chris Jenkins (00:08:03 - 00:08:04)
Yeah, for sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:04 - 00:08:08)
And before we start, this call is being recorded. Are you okay with that?
Chris Jenkins (00:08:09 - 00:08:09)
Sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:10 - 00:08:26)
Okay, so I'm with. My name is Nandini. I'm with Bayard Winds. We're a third party research firm working with Indicia to understand customers, their experiences and try to see if there's anything they can do better.
Chris Jenkins (00:08:27 - 00:08:37)
Okay, Makes sense. I sent a reply email and I replied to the email I got and I also replied to the text messages I got, but I didn't hear back from anyone, so I thought maybe it was just automated boxes or something.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:39 - 00:08:41)
Oh, you didn't get a email confirming this?
Chris Jenkins (00:08:41 - 00:09:14)
No, no, I got an email confirmation, but I actually replied to it with a couple questions on the email and the text. But last week and this week. But I thought maybe it was just like an automated email or something or an automated email box and text message because I didn't hear back. But basically it's okay. I was just wondering, for one, we've been in, I mean, we've been in Indonesia client for probably a decade as a 3PO and I wasn't sure if you were looking for information on anything specific like the, the pricing or the functionality or the communication of our rep or, or whatnot.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:17 - 00:09:22)
Oh, okay. Yeah, we'll go through that. But we just want to know your reaction overall to Indisha as a company.
Chris Jenkins (00:09:22 - 00:09:26)
Okay. I don't know if there's like a certain zone, so just Indisha in general.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:26 - 00:09:36)
Yeah, and I'll go through it when we go through. Yeah. But yeah, if there's anything specific that you want to share, I'm always happy to listen. Okay, awesome.
Chris Jenkins (00:09:36 - 00:09:41)
And then I saw that the 175. How do you. Is that like a Visa gift card or Amazon or how do you do that?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:43 - 00:09:51)
I actually don't know. I think it's a gift card, but I can check that up for you because I don't have the payments. It comes from the platform, so I'm not sure.
Chris Jenkins (00:09:52 - 00:09:53)
Okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:53 - 00:09:57)
But if you want to know, I can check up and get back to you. I'll send you an email.
Chris Jenkins (00:09:57 - 00:09:58)
Yeah, that'd be great.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:59 - 00:10:04)
Okay, so just to start, would you just introduce yourself, your role at the company?
Chris Jenkins (00:10:06 - 00:10:08)
Sure. Chris Jenkins, COO at Warehousing Pro.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:09 - 00:10:15)
Mm. Okay. And so you said you've been using Indicia for a decade, right?
Chris Jenkins (00:10:16 - 00:10:16)
Yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:16 - 00:10:24)
But. Okay. And just during this time, did anybody from Indisha interact with you like the sales team, the account team, anybody?
Chris Jenkins (00:10:25 - 00:10:25)
Yeah, we have a rep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:26 - 00:10:32)
Okay. And how good are they at following up or checking or just checking up on you?
Chris Jenkins (00:10:33 - 00:10:34)
Checking up on us?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:34 - 00:10:40)
Yeah. Like, do they call up and ask you is everything okay? Or do you have any issues or do you need to call them? How does that work?
Chris Jenkins (00:10:41 - 00:12:14)
I. When I'm able to reach our rep, I like her. She's. She's helpful. She's communicative. Well, she's helpful, knowledgeable. When I'm able to reach her and I've worked with her, I don't think she. I've worked with her the whole time. I think we've had multiple Indisha reps, but she's been a rep for a few years. And yeah, I like working with her. I do. She, I. She seldom, if ever, checks in with us. Maybe. I don't know if even. Maybe once a year, if she does that. And I have a lot of difficulty reaching her. Actually, I've been waiting for our. A while to hear back from her. I left her make sure I give you accurate information. So I tried to call her a week ago last Monday, and I couldn't reach her. I left her voicemail. I emailed her that day on Monday. I emailed her a followup on Thursday. I still haven't heard from her, so I'm not sure. Like that. And that's not uncommon. That. Like, sometimes I'll go weeks trying to reach out to her and don't hear back. Sometimes I'll send an email and I'll get an answer the same day, but that's. I don't know. So the communication is. It's not the best. I don't know if she's just overwhelmed or busy or what's up there. But yeah, sometimes, I mean, if I can't reach her by phone or email for over a week, that's not really helpful. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:14 - 00:12:18)
Okay. So sorry.
Chris Jenkins (00:12:18 - 00:12:19)
That's okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:22 - 00:12:31)
I'm just gonna mute my phone. I'm sorry. No problem. I don't know who calls at this time because usually phone is just used for texting, so. That's strange.
Chris Jenkins (00:12:31 - 00:12:32)
I know, right?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:33 - 00:12:37)
That's strange. Usually it's just the credit card companies, you know, calling you, but.
Chris Jenkins (00:12:37 - 00:12:38)
Right, exactly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:38 - 00:12:48)
All right. Sorry about that. So tell me right now, are you using Indicia or. Yes. You've moved away from them and you reduce your usage. What is it?
Chris Jenkins (00:12:50 - 00:12:54)
Neither. We spend probably $5,000 every day or two.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:55 - 00:12:57)
Okay, so you continue using Indicia?
Chris Jenkins (00:12:57 - 00:13:05)
Yeah, I think in the last two weeks we spent about 40 to $50,000 in postage and most of that was disha.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:05 - 00:13:11)
Okay, so I had a question on that. Do you, how does that work? Do you deposit money every week? Like a set amount?
Chris Jenkins (00:13:12 - 00:13:13)
5,000.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:13 - 00:13:14)
Okay.
Chris Jenkins (00:13:14 - 00:13:28)
No, no, we, we purchase, we have an auto buy. So when it gets down to I think 200 or maybe it's a thousand, something like that, when it gets down to a lower amount, then it auto buys 5,000, which happens usually every day or two.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:28 - 00:13:41)
Okay, and do you, are you able to see where that money is used or if there's any outstanding, like at the end of the week, you know, you put in 5,000, but I have so much amount left, so, so that rolls over to the next week. Are you able to see that? Is that transparency in that?
Chris Jenkins (00:13:42 - 00:13:50)
Yep. Yeah, I can log into the site and it's right there in the top right corner of what our balance is. But we don't, we use, we don't use Indicia software. We use Shapiro.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:51 - 00:13:51)
Okay.
Chris Jenkins (00:13:51 - 00:13:52)
Shapiro.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:52 - 00:14:01)
Okay. So are you considering anybody else at all to replace and issue or you're happy with it the way it's working and you're going to continue with that?
Chris Jenkins (00:14:04 - 00:14:50)
I had no plans to switch from Indisha. Well, let me back up. We, yes, we use Indisha, but we have us, we have a USPS nsa. So we have our rates directly with usps. The only reason we use Indicia is just for printing of the labels, but there's no label printing fee or anything. So I think we pay them maybe $30 a month for the maintenance or management fee or whatever to have the account. But our rates are not with Indisha. We just use them as the API provider. But they, I don't know if you're aware, but they, because you're not Indicia, you're a third party. But they Recently, I guess the USPS went to Indisha and said, we want to, we want you to pay us more timely on the postage. Are you aware of that?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:50 - 00:14:51)
No.
Chris Jenkins (00:14:51 - 00:17:30)
Okay, well, USPS want like Indisha wasn't paying them, know if they were paying them once a, like every two weeks or every month or something. But USPS said, hey, if you're going to buy postage from us, you need to pay us more quickly. And I guess Indisha went ahead and they said, okay, look, all, you know, all their customers, they said you need to set up a, or at least, at least NSA customers. You need to set up a payment account with USPS directly so you can still use Indisha, but you're going to pay it USPS for the postage and USPS wasn't ready for that. And Indisha told all or Indisha made that announcement before they even talked to usps. So USPS is pretty disgruntled about it. And I didn't even have that information. I, I had to find that out from usps. I don't know why Indisha didn't tell us that. So the issue, and I'm getting to your question, is that on the new system that USPS wasn't ready for because or they weren't ready for it. So the new system doesn't allow us to use a credit card. You can only use ach. So they said that in beach is working on making a change, hopefully by September. But I'm like, well, I need to, I, I use a business credit card for our postage. I need to use that. And the only way to do that is to switch to USPS Modern, which is basically directly with USPS and not using Disha anymore. That was one of the main reasons that I reached out to my Indicia rep last Monday. A week ago was, hey, hey, usps. They didn't recommend I switch because they can't. They're not allowed to make recommendation. But I asked them, I'm like, hey, I know Indisha doesn't allow us to use a credit card anymore because of this change. Do you all work with any other providers besides Indisha? And they were like, yeah, of course. Yeah we do. And I was like, okay, is there any connection directly with usps? And they said, yes, there is. It's called USPS Modern. And I said, okay, well there cost to that. And they said no. So a week ago I started switching from Indisha to and they were setting me up an account and I tried to call my rep to ask her like, hey, should I do this? What am I missing? Like, I don't want to switch. I, I want to stay with Indisha. But I mean if I can't reach my, my rep for a week, she's kind of losing the business because. And we spend sure probably over a million dollars a year in postage. So I don't know, I haven't heard back from her. So that's a long answer to your question. But, but yes, we are looking. I am in the middle of switching away from Indisha because of this issue and I would rather resolve it with my rep, but she won't answer.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:30 - 00:17:42)
So. Okay, so your main issue is the payment, right? You want to use your credit card and continue with that. But they're saying that you have to use an acs, Right. Is. Is in short, is that what it is?
Chris Jenkins (00:17:42 - 00:18:09)
Yes. Because Indisha said you need to start paying USPS directly. And usps, their system wasn't ready, so they had to like, find an old system that they already had built. And they were like, well, I guess we'll use this in a pinch. And that system's not ready for. It's between Indicia and usps. They're not communicating well on this issue. And so we're kind of stuck in the middle. And they said, well, you can connect using USPS Modern and then that you won't have this issue.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:10 - 00:18:13)
And you reached out to your rep about this and she hasn't replied, correct?
Chris Jenkins (00:18:14 - 00:18:19)
Yeah, I tried to. I tried to call her. I left her voicemail. I emailed her a week ago. I emailed her four days ago.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:22 - 00:18:23)
What is her name?
Chris Jenkins (00:18:24 - 00:18:38)
Selena Romero. Like I said, when I, When I'm able to talk to her, she's nice, she's helpful. She. She's knowledgeable. It's just able to reach her can be difficult. And that's been consistent issue. Sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:38 - 00:18:39)
Okay.
Chris Jenkins (00:18:39 - 00:18:58)
And it seems like it's only gotten worse after we got USPS NSA rates instead of using our Indicia directly. I don't know if that's. Because now she's. They're making less money because, you know, we're not using their rates, they're not making the markup, so maybe we're less of a priority, I don't know. But it seems like now it's really hard to get a hold of her.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:59 - 00:19:13)
So going forward, I mean, I'm just thinking of a hypothetical situation. If they were to call you back and, and solve this issue. If not, Selena, somebody else would reach out to you and solve this issue. Would you continue with them or would you still consider USPS Mordem 100?
Chris Jenkins (00:19:14 - 00:19:54)
I don't want to switch. It's. It's a, It's a hassle for me to switch. And I think there's some things that. For example, Indisha has auto refunds of unused labels. A shipping label doesn't get used, then after two weeks or whatever, we automatically get a refund. I don't think USPS has that. And I like that feature. It works great. But so, and switching our, our systems, there's a bunch of different steps we need to do to make sure that it's done properly. I don't want to switch. It's a hassle to sw. Sure. But I knew the solution and, and the person that would give me that Answer, I can't reach.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:55 - 00:20:00)
And are you happy with them otherwise, other than this, this one issue where she's not getting back to you or.
Chris Jenkins (00:20:00 - 00:20:01)
Or happy with the rep or happy.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:01 - 00:20:03)
With the indicia overall?
Chris Jenkins (00:20:03 - 00:20:14)
Indicia. Yeah, indica works great. I don't have any issues with it. It's. And, and like I said, when I'm able to talk to my rep, she's. I like my rep. It's just being able to reach her.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:14 - 00:20:21)
Have you mentioned that to her, saying, hey, you know, you're really difficult to reach. I mean, tell me something else that I can do to get, get in touch with you faster.
Chris Jenkins (00:20:24 - 00:20:28)
No, no, I have. I didn't want to. I didn't want to piss her off.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:30 - 00:20:31)
Okay, all right, sure.
Chris Jenkins (00:20:32 - 00:20:36)
I mean, it is what it is. So, I mean, I have her phone and her email. I don't really know that there's another way to contact her.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:37 - 00:20:43)
Okay, Is there somebody else higher up that, you know, whose number you're given, saying, hey, you know, I don't think.
Chris Jenkins (00:20:43 - 00:21:02)
I, I have any. Like, I know sometimes their signature lines will say, you know, this is my manager or whatever. It doesn't have that. It just has her email and her phone number. And I don't know that. I don't know if I have anybody else's number at off 10.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:06 - 00:21:25)
Okay. And, and I understand that this issue is big. Okay. But, you know, because you've been dealing with them for a decade, has anything. And you. And you say that she's consistently hard to get in touch with. So has anything else ever come to that point where you said, you know what? I don't want to work with them anymore. I want to switch, or this is the first time that that's happened.
Chris Jenkins (00:21:26 - 00:21:27)
First time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:27 - 00:21:43)
Okay. All right. And who makes this decision? If you, if you consider switching or not switching, who takes that? Is it just you or do you work with somebody else whose opinion matters or just you? Okay. All right, so if they want to.
Chris Jenkins (00:21:43 - 00:21:54)
Fix, help me with the transition, but I mean, the only person over me is the business owner, and he doesn't care. Like, he, he doesn't. Probably doesn't even know what we use. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:56 - 00:22:06)
Okay. And suppose you were to switch to usps. Do you need to do anything else in terms of software or, you know, any other plugins or anything else that you would need to do to, you know?
Chris Jenkins (00:22:07 - 00:23:05)
Yeah, I mean, I have to switch. Well, I had to set up an account. I did that last week. I think Thursday or Friday. I tried. I think it was Thursday or Friday because I was trying during the week to get a hold of the rep and I couldn't reach her. So eventually I was like, look, I gotta, I gotta make a move. So I went ahead and started the process of, of creating an account. So I already have the usp, USPS Modern account set up with you. With usps. They, I did a screen share call with them. They set up the account. I know where to go in our software to get everything changed. And probably this week we'll work on the trans. The migration, the transition from switching from the Indicia account to the other one, getting it plugged in. I mean, unless my, unless I can hear back from my rep. But I'm not going to keep chasing her down. Like, so if she quickly and I, and I'm able to, you know, figure out a solution or if there's a way that we can stay with Indisha. But.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:07 - 00:23:13)
Yeah, okay, if she were to call you like in the next day or two, then maybe you would consider it.
Chris Jenkins (00:23:14 - 00:23:40)
Yeah. And yeah, if she's able to call back and, and get me, give me an answer. I don't expect to be priority like, hey, if I answer, if I call, you need to answer immediately or you need to, you know, respond within two hours. But I mean, a week you should be able to answer. Client that's spending a million dollars within a week. But again, maybe they don't see us as a client spending a million dollars because our rates go through Indisha, but they're not Indisha's rates. So maybe that's, maybe that's the difference. But regardless of your client.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:41 - 00:23:42)
Yeah.
Chris Jenkins (00:23:42 - 00:23:48)
A week is a long time when I have a problem that's making me want to switch, that's making me need to switch to a different provider.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:49 - 00:23:51)
Yeah. At least hear you out.
Chris Jenkins (00:23:51 - 00:23:52)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:52 - 00:23:54)
You know, pick up that phone and. Yeah, yeah.
Chris Jenkins (00:23:54 - 00:24:22)
And me and her. And it's not even like me. I don't need her to just let me complain. I'm not, I don't, I actually, it's not anything about complaining or that they're not doing a good job. It's a technical issue, like, hey, I need to, you know, use my, my credit card. And it's not working in the system. Is there another solution? So it's not like, hey, I'm not happy. Can you try to win my business back? It's like, no, this, there's something that's not working. Do you have a solution for that? But yeah, yeah, yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:22 - 00:24:31)
Okay. Okay. And, and do you usually use multiple providers? Like, I know you said USPS. But do you use others? Do you use FedEx or anybody else for.
Chris Jenkins (00:24:31 - 00:25:01)
We have FedEx UPS in India, but that's because we're three PL so we have clients that. Some clients have their own postage accounts, some use ours. We typically FedEx and UPS are better pricing for heavier package, you know, larger packages. So we do have those accounts because, because we're a third party logistics provider and we, we do fulfill. We have fulfillment services for a lot of different clients, not just our own. And some of them prefer to use a certain carrier.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:02 - 00:25:11)
And do you find that they're more, for lack of a better word, reactive? Like if you had a problem, you know, did they get back to you soon?
Chris Jenkins (00:25:19 - 00:26:07)
Sometimes like, well, we, we had a FedEx rep that was great. He, he was local. He would come in and check on us. We could get an answer. He's very helpful. Then they switched us to another like another rep that was more, not outsourced but like a different level and she's not as, as helpful. So it just depends on kind of which rep we're getting. You know, a lot of it's based around volume. If you do a lot of volume, they listen to you and if you don't do a lot of volume, then they're. They. You kind of get pushed towards the back of the line. But when that happens, then it makes me not want to give more volume. So the majority of our volume now is on Indisha. And like I said, I don't really have any issues with them. But if we do have a. In the rare, in the few instances that we have a question, it's usually pretty hard to get an answer.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:08 - 00:26:23)
Okay, and, and when you decided to switch to usps, I mean in the process of, did you ask them or did USPS reach out to you? How did you get to know of this, this change that Indicia. You know that your system is not going to be working in future and.
Chris Jenkins (00:26:23 - 00:26:32)
You had a problem and you USPS reached out to, said, hey, you have to go into our system. My, our USPS rep. Because I have a, we have an, you know, Octane.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:33 - 00:26:33)
Yes.
Chris Jenkins (00:26:34 - 00:27:39)
So we have an octane rep who, you know, Selena. And we also have a USPS rep. My USPS rep is probably the most helpful, like consistently helpful and responsive. He reached out to us and he was like, hey, you need. Because he's the one that we actually have an NSA with. We do the most value. We do, oh, you know, over a million dollars a year posted directly with usps. So he's getting Quite a bit of volume. We don't do as much FedEx, we don't do as much ups. Indicia is just flowing our rates through them. But our USPS rep is pretty responsive. He reached out and said, hey, you need to go into our system and you're going to need to set up an EPS account for your payment. And I say, okay, why do we need to do that? And he was explaining, you know, well, it's because of this situation with Indisha. And they, they pulled the trigger and said that they're going to make this change, but they didn't really work with us on it because they just said, fine, we're going to tell our clients to. And it's leaving people in the, it's leaving clients in the middle. And so he's like, we're trying to figure out what we can do to make it work. And he told me, I need to set up this account directly with USPS because that's what Indisha said needs to be done.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:40 - 00:27:42)
Okay. All right.
Chris Jenkins (00:27:42 - 00:28:07)
And I don't think my Indisha rep ever said. He said, he said Indisha was telling their clients. I don't think my, my Indisha rep ever told me anything about this. I found out about it from a USPS rep. So that's why I was like, I've got questions that he can't answer. That my indication that Indicia needs to answer. But if I can't reach my rep, like, I need to hear her side of it. Like, sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:09 - 00:28:18)
Yeah. And I'm wondering if this change is something that the rep needs to tell you or like the company itself needs to, you know, send you some kind of, I don't know, just like, yeah.
Chris Jenkins (00:28:18 - 00:28:36)
I don't think I got anything from a dish, either from our rep or corporate or an automated email or like, heads up, this is happening. I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't. The first time I saw about it, I think was, are the only times I've heard about it were from USPS saying, hey, you, you're an Indicia customer now. You have to go set up this thing, this and that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:37 - 00:28:40)
And this information is verified, right? I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's correct.
Chris Jenkins (00:28:40 - 00:28:41)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:41 - 00:28:45)
You check that out. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I just find it strange.
Chris Jenkins (00:28:45 - 00:28:51)
All right. Well, it's at least as far as I know. I would like to verify it further by asking my rep, but that goes back to not being able to reach my rep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:51 - 00:29:03)
Sorry, yeah. And did you know of Andicio's affiliation with the Ship Station? It's multi carrier.
Chris Jenkins (00:29:04 - 00:29:11)
I know that Indisha has an affiliation with Ship Station. Yeah, I do. But we don't use Ship Station. We use Shapiro.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:13 - 00:29:14)
It's Ship Hero.
Chris Jenkins (00:29:14 - 00:29:15)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:15 - 00:29:21)
Is that a multi station provider as well? Yes. Okay. Okay.
Chris Jenkins (00:29:23 - 00:29:33)
So other than that Shipping software and inventory. Ship Station is only shipping software. Shapiro is inventory and ship. And it's a full wms. So we use that for our warehouse management.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:34 - 00:29:38)
Yeah, wms. Warehouse Management solution. Correct.
Chris Jenkins (00:29:38 - 00:29:48)
Yeah, Warehouse management system. We've used ShipStation in the past. We used ChipStation for years and. But our platform now is Shapiro.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:49 - 00:30:00)
Okay. So, okay, I guess this is reiterating the same thing because I was going to ask you what could Indicia have done? And the answer is yeah, we'll get them. Talk to me.
Chris Jenkins (00:30:00 - 00:30:01)
But yeah, exactly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:02 - 00:30:18)
Is there anything else at all that they could have done? I mean, should they have. Do you think that other than the rep calling you just like an automated email saying hey, this is what is happening and this is what you need to do. Would that have helped you more than the rep actually getting back to you and talking to you? What would you have preferred?
Chris Jenkins (00:30:19 - 00:31:09)
Well, I mean having a heads up from Indicia. So because when USPS said hey, you need to go like that, he sent me the instructions, hey, you need to set up an EPS account and do this and that. And I saw the screenshots and I, I was looking at it, I didn't even understand initially what it was for, why we were doing it. Yeah, I didn't know that it was to set like we were gonna, I thought it was to set up a payment account, but it was more like a, A, like to verify our company or like a backup payment method. I didn't realize what it was, was to actually pay USPS directly for all of our postage. And we weren't going to pay Indicia anymore. We were only going to use Indicia for the API. Like the rates are with usps, we're paying usps, but we're just having the labels printed by Indisha. So I didn't really understand what it was. And finally when I got on the call with him and the like.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:12 - 00:31:13)
Like.
Chris Jenkins (00:31:13 - 00:32:17)
An integrations person that were helping with the process, I was like, okay, I don't really understand. I understand what you want me to do. I don't, I don't understand why like why are we doing this? And then they, the whole situation with Indisha, they did this and so now you can't you need to set up a payment to pay USPS directly. I'm like, oh, wow, that's a big deal. That seems like something that Indicia probably should have given me a heads up on. So, yeah, having an email in advance from Indisha to know like, hey, this is going to happen and here's what you're going to need to do would have been helpful. But it sounds like it was sort of hurried and both sides are kind of upset at each other and not really communicating well. And so clients are getting left in the dark. And so I'm like just trying to find a solution. That's why it was interesting when I got the email saying, hey, do you want to do a review like right now? Because I was like, did is the fact that I set up a USPS Modern account or that trigger something or it just seemed odd that, you know, they want. You wanted to do a, you know, a review of Indicia right now in the middle of. This was good timing, I guess.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:19 - 00:32:36)
Yeah. Okay, I'll make a note of that. Saying somebody has to reach out to you for sure. Okay, so do you think if somebody actually did? Because I'm going to make a note of it right now as soon as our interview is over. But if somebody would reach out to you like in the next day or two, would you still consider Indonesia? Because I know it's a hassle to shift to somebody new.
Chris Jenkins (00:32:37 - 00:33:42)
Yeah, for sure. I don't want to switch. It's already set up. I, I like, everything's in place. It's gonna be more work for me and it's not really going to change the, like, the cost is going to be about the same because the USPS isn't going to charge us anything. Indisha only charges us like, I think it's $30 a month, like a management fee or something. But Indisha also has some things like the auto refund of the labels, which is worth it to me to have that. And it's already set up. So no, I don't want to switch. And Indicia hasn't done a bad job, like, but it's just technically it tech. Like, technically there are some things that I need to be able to do and if I can't do it, but somebody can help me figure out how to or if they can say like, hey, yes, you're right, you can't add a credit card today, but actually that's going to be fixed two weeks from now. And like, okay, great, like, not a big deal. But I don't know. I Don't. I don't know if what the USPS is telling me is 100% correct or maybe they're inaccurate about something. So, yeah, for sure. If somebody could call me in the next couple of days and help me figure it out, I would love to stay. I don't want to switch.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:43 - 00:33:52)
Okay, sure. I know at the beginning of the call you mentioned that you had. You sent an email with some questions or what was it that you wanted to ask? Is this something we haven't covered or.
Chris Jenkins (00:33:53 - 00:34:08)
Oh, no, it was just what we. The two things that I asked you at the beginning of the call, like what topics that you wanted to talk about. If it was about pricing or the rep or whatever. And then how the 1 7. How the 175 was. If it's a Visa gift card or Amazon or how you guys do it because it just, it didn't say.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:09 - 00:34:15)
Yeah, it's not an Amazon gift card, but it's an independent payment platform, I think. So I would assume another gift card.
Chris Jenkins (00:34:15 - 00:34:15)
Not.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:16 - 00:34:22)
I don't know. But if you're. Are you particular about a specific way of getting payment or.
Chris Jenkins (00:34:22 - 00:34:36)
No, I just want to make sure it wasn't because I know some places do like here's a gift card or like a credit or whatever, but it only works for. It's like $175 towards buying a $300 item from a website. It's really just a discount code. You know what I mean?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:36 - 00:34:42)
No, no, no. I think it's more like a generic gift card. You can use it for anything. Yeah, but I just don't know exactly what it is.
Chris Jenkins (00:34:42 - 00:34:44)
No worries if you're particular.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:44 - 00:34:45)
I'll. I'll get back to you.
Chris Jenkins (00:34:45 - 00:35:09)
I mean, I was checking to see. Yeah, it looks like we pay indicia, like 20, usually about $22 a month is like a management fee. So that's not. It's not a big deal. I don't. It's not like we're switching to save money or anything.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:10 - 00:35:14)
That's the management fee. But you still deposit money for them to get the labels and everything done, right?
Chris Jenkins (00:35:15 - 00:35:41)
Yeah, like, but we don't. That's. I'm talking about paying indicia as a fee, but for this postage, like we put $5,000 in our indisha account and then it just. On credit and then it just prints postage from that. Okay, but they don't charge us like a per label fee to print the labels or anything like that. So it's not like, oh, they charge us 5 cents a label, but USPS is going to charge us 3 cents a label or something. It's not. We're not switching to save money in that sense.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:42 - 00:35:48)
Okay. Fair. Well, I don't have anything else. Any other questions? Is there anything else you want to tell me or.
Chris Jenkins (00:35:49 - 00:35:50)
Nope. That's it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:50 - 00:35:54)
Okay. All right. I'll make sure somebody calls you in the next year or two, for sure.
Chris Jenkins (00:35:54 - 00:35:55)
Sounds good. I appreciate it. Thank you for your time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:56 - 00:35:57)
Thanks. Bye.
Chris Jenkins (00:35:57 - 00:35:57)
Bye.

8. Retention Strategies: Determine what incentives (e.g., revenue sharing, free service, compliance management) could retain or grow Endicia’s customer base (Candi, 00:11:15-00:12:32; Anthony, 00:14:10-00:16:20; Chris S, 00:24:19-00:25:56).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. USPS Direct as Primary Competitor: USPS’s improved API, credit card payment options, and aggressive sales tactics (e.g., revenue sharing, no label fees) drive churn, particularly through tech partners like ProShip (Candi, 00:08:13-00:09:02; Anthony, 00:12:14-00:13:32; Chris S, 00:05:41-00:06:19).
2. Limited Multi-Carrier Appeal: Endicia’s single-carrier focus (USPS) limits appeal for customers with multi-carrier needs, especially if tech partners don’t support ShipStation API (Candi, 00:06:22-00:08:13; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
3. Pricing as a Barrier: Endicia’s label fees and lack of timely pricing updates deter customers, especially when USPS or competitors offer no-fee or revenue-sharing models (Anthony, 00:19:30-00:20:55; Candi, 00:25:29-00:25:56).
4. Tech Partner Dependency: Customers tied to tech partners (e.g., ProShip, Shapiro) are unlikely to switch to ShipStation API due to integration costs and established systems, leading to churn when partners move to USPS direct (Candi, 00:07:28-00:10:00; Anthony, 00:11:37-00:12:12).
5. Regional Carriers as Opportunity: Offering regional carriers through ShipStation API could be a differentiator, but customers may not recognize this value or be willing to invest in integration (Candi, 00:19:34-00:22:39; Chris S, 00:19:34-00:21:39).
