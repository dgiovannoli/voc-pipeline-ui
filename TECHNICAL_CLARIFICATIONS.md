# 🔧 Technical Clarifications for VOC Pipeline Methodology

## **📊 Data Processing Specifics**

### **Impact Scoring Algorithm (1-5 Scale)**

The impact scoring system uses a weighted algorithm with specific criteria:

#### **Scoring Components:**
1. **Stakeholder Weight (0-200 points)**
   - Executive/Budget Holder: +200 points
   - Champion: +150 points  
   - End User/IT Technical: +100 points

2. **Deal Impact Factors (0-100 points each)**
   - Deal Tipping Point: +100 points
   - Differentiator Factor: +80 points
   - Blocker Factor: +80 points

3. **Salience Levels (0-60 points)**
   - High Salience: +60 points
   - Medium Salience: +40 points

4. **Evidence Strength (0-50 points)**
   - Strong Positive/Negative Sentiment: +50 points

5. **Quote Length & Specificity (0-30 points)**
   - >30 words: +30 points
   - >20 words: +20 points
   - >10 words: +10 points

6. **Business Impact Indicators (0-15 points)**
   - Revenue, cost, profit, loss, churn, retention, growth, competitive, deal terms: +15 points each

7. **Competitive Dynamics (0-15 points)**
   - Competitor, alternative, versus, compared, switching, instead: +15 points each

#### **Final Score Calculation:**
```
Impact Score = (Total Points / 500) * 5
```
This normalizes to a 1-5 scale where:
- **1**: Low impact (0-100 points)
- **2**: Below average (101-200 points)
- **3**: Average impact (201-300 points)
- **4**: High impact (301-400 points)
- **5**: Exceptional impact (401-500 points)

### **Narrative Coherence Definition (Gate 4)**

Narrative coherence is measured by sentiment consistency within theme clusters:

#### **Coherence Threshold: 70%**
- **For Strength Themes**: ≥70% of quotes must be positive sentiment
- **For Weakness Themes**: ≥70% of quotes must be negative sentiment
- **For Mixed Signal Themes**: No coherence requirement (skipped)

#### **Calculation Method:**
```python
sentiment_coherence = (quotes['sentiment'] == expected_sentiment).mean()
coherence_passed = sentiment_coherence >= 0.7
```

### **LLM Enhancement Process**

#### **Trigger Conditions:**
- Theme passes all quality gates
- Minimum 3 supporting quotes
- Cross-company validation confirmed

#### **Prompt Guidelines:**
1. **Two-Sentence Executive Framework**
   - Sentence 1: Decision behavior or specific problem with consequence (25-35 words)
   - Sentence 2: Most common interviewee pain point or reaction (25-35 words)

2. **Evidence-Based Requirements**
   - Extract specific customer pain points from findings
   - Use concrete details like timeframes, specific errors, user behaviors
   - Avoid generic statements

3. **Executive Language Constraints**
   - No solutioning language ("indicating a need for", "suggesting", "recommending")
   - No industry-specific terms (legal, medical, financial)
   - Use universal business language

4. **Consistency Measures**
   - Temperature: 0.1 (low randomness)
   - Max tokens: 3000
   - Model: gpt-4o-mini
   - Validation checkpoints in prompt

### **Quality Gate Thresholds**

#### **Gate 1: Cross-Company Validation**
- **Requirement**: Minimum 2 companies per theme
- **Adaptive**: Can be reduced to 1 for single-company datasets
- **Validation**: `unique_companies >= min_companies_per_theme`

#### **Gate 2: Evidence Significance**
- **Requirement**: Minimum 3 quotes per theme
- **Adaptive**: Can be reduced to 2 for smaller datasets
- **Validation**: `len(quotes) >= min_quotes_per_theme`

#### **Gate 3: Impact Threshold**
- **Requirement**: Average impact score ≥ 3.0
- **Adaptive**: Based on data quality (2.5-3.5 range)
- **Validation**: `avg_impact >= min_impact_threshold`

#### **Gate 4: Narrative Coherence**
- **Requirement**: 70% sentiment consistency
- **Validation**: `sentiment_coherence >= 0.7`
- **Skip Condition**: Mixed signal themes

## **🎯 Quality Gate Details**

### **Partial Gate Failure Handling**

When a theme fails one gate but passes others:

1. **Logging**: All gate results are logged with specific failure reasons
2. **Analyst Override**: Themes can be manually promoted despite gate failures
3. **Quality Score**: Failed gates reduce the overall quality score
4. **Evidence Review**: Analysts can review supporting evidence to make decisions

### **Manual Promotion Process**

Themes can be manually promoted through:
- **Excel Workbook**: Dropdown options in validation tabs
- **Streamlit UI**: Decision tracking interface
- **Override Capabilities**: Include rejected themes in final analysis

### **Conflicting Quotes Handling**

When quotes within the same theme have conflicting sentiment:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Each quote is individually scored for sentiment
2. **Coherence Check**: Overall sentiment consistency is calculated
3. **Split Decision**: If coherence < 70%, theme may be split or rejected
4. **Analyst Review**: Conflicting evidence is highlighted for analyst decision

### **Quality Scoring Algorithm (0-10 Scale)**

```python
def calculate_quality_score(quotes, theme_type):
    score = 0.0
    
    # 1. Company Coverage (40% weight)
    unique_companies = quotes['company'].nunique()
    company_score = min(unique_companies / 4.0, 1.0) * 4.0
    score += company_score
    
    # 2. Evidence Quality (30% weight)
    avg_impact = quotes['impact_score'].mean()
    evidence_score = (avg_impact / 5.0) * 3.0
    score += evidence_score
    
    # 3. Quote Volume (20% weight)
    quote_count = len(quotes)
    volume_score = min(quote_count / 10.0, 1.0) * 2.0
    score += volume_score
    
    # 4. Theme Coherence (10% weight)
    if theme_type in ["strength", "weakness"]:
        expected_sentiment = "positive" if theme_type == "strength" else "negative"
        coherence = (quotes['sentiment'] == expected_sentiment).mean()
        coherence_score = coherence * 1.0
        score += coherence_score
    
    return score
```

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Within each subject, group by sentiment (positive/negative/mixed)
   - Calculate sentiment distribution
   - Identify dominant sentiment patterns

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Use TF-IDF + DBSCAN clustering
   - Similarity threshold: 0.3 minimum
   - Minimum cluster size: 2 quotes
   - Identify common themes within sentiment groups

4. **Quality Assessment**
   - Apply all quality gates sequentially
   - Calculate quality scores
   - Log gate pass/fail results

5. **LLM Enhancement**
   - Generate theme statements using executive framework
   - Apply consistency guidelines
   - Validate against source evidence

### **Multi-Subject Theme Handling**

Themes that span multiple harmonized subjects are handled through:

1. **Primary Subject Assignment**
   - Identify the most dominant subject
   - Calculate subject relevance scores
   - Assign to highest-scoring subject

2. **Cross-Reference Creation**
   - Create cross-section reference tabs
   - Link themes to all relevant subjects
   - Provide navigation between sections

3. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Check for theme similarity across subjects
   - Merge similar themes when appropriate
   - Maintain unique theme IDs

### **LLM Enhancement Triggers**

#### **Trigger Conditions:**
