Speaker 1 (01:00):
[00:01:00] Hi, Brian.

Speaker 2 (01:10):
Hey, how's it going?

Speaker 1 (01:11):
Well, how are you?

Speaker 2 (01:12):
Good, good.

Speaker 1 (01:16):
The coolest part about my job, especially with Ship Out, is I get to meet the coolest products all day long. I get to go out as unbiased conversations with CEOs, founders. It's, [00:01:30] I love this part. I have other clients where it's not as fun. You can imagine talking to a bunch of lawyers have the same kind of energy, doesn't have the same interest. I'm not trying products, but this morning, who did I talk to? Somebody who had just a really cool packaged bone broth and matcha tea type of business. And then now I get to talk to you completing the puzzle. Thanks.

(02:00):
[00:02:00] Here's the context. I worked with ShipBob for over a year now, a third party unbiased interviews of people who have evaluated their software and chosen to buy or not buy. And the goal is to help them improve the way they serve their customers and earn new business. With your permission, we have a 20 minute conversation about 2025. It's recorded, but used only privately, internally for ShipBob to evaluate how they can improve. [00:02:30] And we put together reports, 30 reports over a quarter that look at what themes are emerging on, where they're falling down and can improve and where they're doing well. Does that all sound good to you? And do you Okay, give us permission to record?

Speaker 2 (02:44):
Yes. Yes.

Speaker 1 (02:45):
Awesome. Well, great. The context I have here is that you evaluated them fairly recently, but chose not to move ahead. Is that all correct?

Speaker 2 (02:55):
Correct.

Speaker 1 (02:56):
Awesome. And that you were the CEO of the puzzle.

Speaker 2 (03:00):
[00:03:00] Correct.

Speaker 1 (03:01):
Great. Well then we're good to go. When you went to evaluate them, what was your current solution at the time

Speaker 2 (03:13):
With custom,

Speaker 1 (03:15):
As in you had your own warehouse and you were managing yourself

Speaker 2 (03:19):
Own warehouse, own software, own negotiated rates.

Speaker 1 (03:24):
Great. And what prompted you to consider options outside of that?

Speaker 2 (03:30):
[00:03:30] We're at the point where I either need to open up other warehouses or find someone that has a three PL network that I can rent little spaces from to take advantage of economies of scale at shipping. So we have enough volume where it's making sense. It doesn't make sense for me to open up my own little warehouses, but it does make sense to rent little spaces cost [00:04:00] efficient. And so it was like two parts that I was looking for was, one was that, and the other thing was I spend a large majority of my time negotiating shipping rights and keeping the vendor relationships positive. It's a struggle. It's not actually something that I enjoy some of it and I enjoy the people, but it's also, [00:04:30] it's a little taxing sometimes. And I was

Speaker 1 (04:33):
It's not why you started the business

Speaker 2 (04:34):
A hundred percent. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably the more fair description of it. I don't know. I get wind and dined to places. I went to A UFC event. I don't know if you're a UFC fan. That's part of the canvas. No way. Yeah, it is Front row seat one. Row one. It was cool. That is

Speaker 1 (04:57):
Cool. Who took you

Speaker 2 (05:00):
[00:05:00] Easy post.

Speaker 1 (05:01):
Very cool.

Speaker 2 (05:02):
Yeah. And so if you're a UFC fan, your I favor sat behind me. So that was like dope. My goodness. That is awesome. Yeah, it that made my experience, but it also opened my eyes where it's like there's a lot of money in this, so maybe if I can get someone that's not going to take me front row and give me a little bit better rates. Let's see. And yeah, so I was looking for someone to take all of that [00:05:30] off because as cool as that is, it's not really what I started it for.

Speaker 1 (05:34):
Sure. And as you started to look at new vendors, how did you source them and what was your evaluation criteria?

Speaker 2 (05:46):
How did I source them? Going to events. Events, Google asking friends. So I'm in a mastermind with 24. There's 25 of us in this mastermind. I ask them [00:06:00] go to events like subs, summit Shop Talk and Pack Expo, all the packing stuff and then Googling and just seeing competitive analysis, just like Ship Hero verse. And then ShipBob ISS going to come up, ship easy verse, and it'll pop up with ShipBob or something like that. Sure. And I'm tangentially friends with a C-suite [00:06:30] or a founder of ShipBob. I forget who and who the friend is, but I think that person's in the mastermind and that was the original intro.

Speaker 1 (06:42):
Got it. And did you have a set of criteria going in these five things matter to me, or was it more, let me feel it out.

Speaker 2 (06:50):
Yeah, the main thing was if you're going to charge a subscription fee and fees on top, do that and don't charge me on [00:07:00] rates or charge me on rates. I don't want this double dipping, then I'm just going to feel taken advantage of. And I, I'd rather just have it be super transparent and I'd rather just get your pass through rates and then you just charge me what you want to make just so I can feel like we're actually having a partner and relationship versus me always second guessing, are they overcharging me? What's going on here? Was number one.

Speaker 1 (07:30):
[00:07:30] Okay. So rates and the way they charged, not double dipping number one.

Speaker 2 (07:35):
Yep.

Speaker 1 (07:35):
What would be the other few?

Speaker 2 (07:42):
I think that's number one, and the rest came down to did I like them? Was it efficient? Were they going to have as little errors as possible? So when I think about shipping, I think there are three legs, price, speed, and quality [00:08:00] for returns. I don't care about speed. I can always float the inventory, so I want it to be low price and high quality. And if it's super, super slow, great. That's the ideal scenario.

Speaker 1 (08:13):
Yeah. Let me launch, if you don't mind, we have a little one survey question that we have right on the screen.

Speaker 2 (08:20):
Sure.

Speaker 1 (08:21):
And it's about different pillars. Other people evaluate three pls on. And so this is not your rating of ShipBob. This is your [00:08:30] evaluation of how these things matter to you.

Speaker 3 (08:35):
Okay.

Speaker 2 (08:45):
What's interesting with two is I want it to be reliable and cost effective, but I don't care about being price or nevermind, I said that backwards. I want it to be reliable and cost effective, but I don't care about the speed. [00:09:00] I think in my opinion, number two is the biggest thing with three pls and just any shipping vendor enable customizations at scale. I don't really care. Or is it like zip ball? There you go. That was fancy. I've never done a poll Inside.

Speaker 1 (09:28):
It's our full-time gig. We get fancy [00:09:30] with our surveys and questions.

Speaker 2 (09:32):
It is.

Speaker 1 (09:35):
I need to ask you about questions about the shipping, but I want to ask you questions about the puzzle as a founder. So I'll leave that for the last couple minutes. It seems like you've got a fairly standard shipping package. You're not adding a bunch of, you're not kidding a bunch of things together, but I could be wrong. Where there's specific [00:10:00] needs at a use case or industry that you were looking for, some people might say, Hey, I need people who are pros to selling fragrances or food, or did that matter to you?

Speaker 4 (10:12):
Nope.

Speaker 1 (10:13):
Yep. If you don't mind sharing what vendors did you look at?

Speaker 2 (10:29):
Some I don't [00:10:30] want to share the ones I will share Worldwide Express. And then the rest are just kind of one-offs to be honest. What do you mean taken?

Speaker 1 (10:46):
What do you mean by that?

Speaker 2 (10:48):
Regional three pls. So piecing together the puzzle of return shipping, so using different regional people, someone to handle [00:11:00] la, someone to handle Atlanta, someone to handle Chicago, and then Pennsylvania ish area.

Speaker 1 (11:12):
Did you end up choosing another vendor

Speaker 2 (11:16):
In the process? There's actually one, a competitor to Ship Bob that is going to do, honestly going to do everything I wanted Ship Bobb to do. They're passing through the rates, [00:11:30] we have a per label markup, and then we have a flat subscription fee and they're passing through the rates a hundred percent. And they were actually super transparent. They're like, these are the rates. And I was like, yeah, I know they sent me more than enough. And I've now talked to enough vendors where I know that they're not marking it up. Yeah,

Speaker 1 (11:55):
Great. I would love to hear about [00:12:00] comparative strengths and weaknesses of ShipBob, right? So across that vendor, what do you think the biggest gap that ShipBob failed to meet? Your expectations or weaknesses or just reasons why you didn't go with them? We'll start there.

Speaker 2 (12:17):
It was honestly the people, because I've talked to ShipBob two or three times now,

(12:26):
And I kind of have the exact same conversation that I have with everyone [00:12:30] where I'm like, don't upcharge me on the rates, just charge me. I want to know what your margin is. I want to have a relationship and a partnership, and that's what I view it as. And if you don't want to, that's fine, but if you want to, we can keep going down the road. And they're like, okay. And then ShipBob is the slowest to get back to me, and at the end they end up marking up the rates and charging a subscription fee and I'm like, you're just wasting my time. And it was frustrating. So it's just [00:13:00] the people I say, Hey, don't touch the red button. And then they're like, we won't. And then two months later they just press the button and you're just like, Ugh. It's just disappointing from a humanity moral standpoint, to be honest.

Speaker 1 (13:20):
We actually have a set of questions around the pricing experience, something we're looking into, and one of 'em is just like, [00:13:30] how long did it take you to receive pricing from ShipBob

Speaker 2 (13:34):
Long? They're probably the longest

Speaker 1 (13:41):
Talking months, weeks, days.

Speaker 3 (13:47):
Yeah. I

Speaker 2 (13:55):
April 23rd to July 11th and just to get a no.

Speaker 1 (14:00):
[00:14:00] Now, in that time period, were there back and forth where you were providing them data or is that simply They needed April 23rd and they were responded in July

Speaker 2 (14:11):
Latter that, wow,

Speaker 1 (14:14):
That's not great.

Speaker 2 (14:15):
No, no. And so the whole, this most recent conversation started [00:14:30] early February, so it took February until June 11th. Let's see,

Speaker 3 (14:45):
The earliest,

Speaker 2 (14:47):
Oh man, I can't off the top of my head find or just in this moment find the first conversation, [00:15:00] but the earliest email that I can see, oh, January, Nope. Oh, it is January 8th. So we talked from January 8th, gathered data went back and forth until April 23rd. Yeah, April 23rd. And then from April 23rd I just sat waiting, and [00:15:30] then June 11th I got a rejection that they weren't going to be able to do it. It was a long time. That's six months. It's crazy.

Speaker 1 (15:38):
How long did the competitors take?

Speaker 2 (15:42):
The longest one is, they just actually sent it today, three weeks. He just sent it today, so I, I can pull it up June 4th [00:16:00] to July 3rd. That was the longest, so 29 days.

Speaker 1 (16:03):
Okay. And then you were even faster than that,

Speaker 2 (16:08):
Correct? Yeah, the normal turnaround time is two and a half, three weeks. The only, I actually will give the people that just responded today a pass, because in the middle of it there was a most recently rate increase, so it caused some back and forth. They communicated that, so the expectation was that [00:16:30] it didn't go the 29 days without communication with ShipBob, with these guys, they preemptively reached out and said like, Hey, as you know, industry changes and it's taken a little longer with ShipBob. It was just nothing.

Speaker 1 (16:47):
How about any experience from January to April? What was that experience like in terms of pricing and just sales?

Speaker 2 (16:59):
At the [00:17:00] time, it was fine and it actually seemed really productive. And then at the end it just seemed misleading. It ended up being, it was disappointing in the end because it was overcharging on the rates, charges, subscription fee, which I asked not to do. And then when I pushed back, it was from whatever dates I told you, just silence and then [00:17:30] a rejection. I don't know. It doesn't take that long to know that you don't want to do it.

Speaker 1 (17:36):
Was just so I have clarity, was the April 23rd to July timeframe a response to your pushback or a timeline to get the original pricing?

Speaker 2 (17:47):
No. So the original pricing came around in April, so it was April to June, not July. I think I misspoke. So it was April 23rd to June 11th. That [00:18:00] time period was like I pushed back on April 23rd, and then it was basically that gap was them. I don't know. That was the gap for the rejection.

Speaker 1 (18:11):
Got it. Excuse me, pushing but to something they want to learn about. And just how long did they kind of meet industry standard in terms of how long it took them to get to the original pricing? A few weeks.

Speaker 2 (18:23):
It wasn't the worst. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I would say the original thing was kind of fine.

Speaker 1 (18:29):
If [00:18:30] they had matched the pricing you needed right in the format and the number, would they have won the deal? Would they have not won the deal and why? If pricing matched exactly like what you're going with today?

Speaker 2 (18:45):
Yeah, I think out of the gate. So I had a bad experience, a very similar experience two years ago with them. Let's say all that experience is down and it's just starting fresh with Chip, it's [00:19:00] called Chip Bobb two, and it was the exact same software and everything probably. I mean, their software and locations and everything else seemed awesome. It was honestly just the people.

Speaker 1 (19:18):
Yeah. And when you say people, I'm hearing process to engage with and get pricey and concessions, was it more than that? Was there a bad experience, just one-to-one with the person [00:19:30] on the phone also?

Speaker 2 (19:32):
Yeah, the first person I talked with, the first person organically, and then the next person I talked with at Subs Summit and then this last person, they all said this exact same thing, which makes me feel like it's a trained thing or learned. When I pushed back on, why are you marking up the postage? They say, because we have to make money. All [00:20:00] three of them said the exact same thing. And I was like, it's fine. But I started every conversation saying that I wanted you to be transparent with how much money you want to make, and they're just like, we're not telling you we have to make money. And it's just like it was the slimiest feeling.

Speaker 1 (20:21):
All right. It sounds like there were positives. So as we want to move to that, you mentioned, I believe different locations [00:20:30] and technology, but could you expand upon what you think they did?

Speaker 2 (20:34):
Well, I think their tech's pretty interesting. The way that they digitize the warehouse. They would spend time understanding our layout, giving us guidance on the layout. The API looked pretty dope, honestly probably one of the better APIs that I've seen. From a tech perspective, I was pretty excited to [00:21:00] integrate with their software. And from a logistics perspective, I've visited their warehouse in Dallas and it seemed pretty like it was a clean warehouse cleaner than this other one I went today. And yeah, logistically and software wise, they seem to have it down.

Speaker 1 (21:20):
Yeah, cool. One of my favorite questions is to ask if you were [00:21:30] the CEO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve companies like yours? And obviously I know the pricing, we kind of went into that in detail, so that aside, assume that's number one. Is there anything else that you would do to just better serve companies like completing the puzzle

Speaker 2 (21:48):
Preemptively, give a timeline of rough outline of how long things should take. It was just a really long time [00:22:00] without any notification and there was no expectation.

Speaker 1 (22:05):
Yeah,

Speaker 2 (22:06):
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (22:09):
Now we talked about ShipBob did well or not well. Is there anything that the other vendors did that kind shined that you think like, Hey, ShipBob would benefit from hearing that the company did this part of the sales process or demo? Well, including or outside of the tickets to a [00:22:30] cool UFC match?

Speaker 2 (22:31):
The tickets to the match was actually, to me, it's actually a negative. I'll do it all day long, but then I'm just like, you're making more money. A dinner is fine. Or honestly, the thing that does it for me is buying my employees, bringing coffee for the employees, coffee and donuts for the employees. I can do what I want. If I wanted to go to the UFC, I could probably just pay for myself. Now, it's cool if someone one's paying for it, but what matters more to me is [00:23:00] the employees and them feeling like they get something.

(23:05):
The thing that the other vendors that I liked and the one that I'm going with, they didn't waste time on the calls in a long drawn out presentation. I used to work for Booz Allen and it was very corporate [00:23:30] doing consulting, and we would do 20 page slideshows that were like, this is the benefits of working with Booz Allen and all this stuff. And I'm like, okay, it doesn't really do much for me. And there was lot of that with ShipBob and I was just like, I get that ShipBob is proud of ShipBob, but ShipBob didn't seem proud to work with me. And all the other vendors literally had one or no slides about themselves and then [00:24:00] jumped immediately into me, and it just didn't waste time either. So I had a call with the one today and we spent, it was a 30 minute call. We spent the last 15 minutes talking about our dogs because they just got right to it versus ship Bob's the best.

Speaker 1 (24:19):
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (24:20):
So

Speaker 1 (24:21):
Yeah. Is there any topics that I did not ask about but you think ShipBob would value [00:24:30] learning about? When you think about three pls, you think about ShipBob, it's like, oh yeah, we didn't talk about the demo, or something like that.

Speaker 2 (24:42):
Not really. I think I could, just going back to the wasted stuff,

(24:49):
I'm barely fine asking for demos and seeing specific things, especially if I know about it. [00:25:00] I don't necessarily think this is a ShipBob thing, but I think in general, if someone is, I noticed this with one of the vendors, they didn't quite get that. We do a hundred percent round trip shipping and they spent a lot of time focusing on the outbound. And the outbound we have down to a science at this point. And it was just like they kept talking about wanting to take over my outbound. I was like, I'm on this call for returns. And I think in general, just vendors understanding, kind of going [00:25:30] back to the whole thing, less about ShipBob, more about me. I mean, I'm selfish. I'm the one paying it, so I kind of want to just know what are you doing for me type of thing. And then we can joke around about dogs or something. But yeah.

Speaker 1 (25:44):
Awesome. Well, Brian, thank you for your time today.

Speaker 2 (25:47):
Yeah, it

Speaker 1 (25:48):
Was great to meet you. It's a cool product too. Thanks. Check it out. I've got kids, they're six and four. I feel like we do a lot of [00:26:00] the same puzzles over and over again, so maybe this is a good, obviously we're going to resonate with what you're doing here.

Speaker 2 (26:06):
Cool. Yeah, man. I fell in love with this line from Cobble Hill. It's called a family puzzle. On one side it starts with really big pieces, and then on the other side it goes down to normal size pieces. So in the same puzzle, you can puzzle it with your kids. You can do the smaller pieces and [00:26:30] they can do the bigger ones. And you too, like meat in the middle.

Speaker 1 (26:33):
That's a great idea.

Speaker 2 (26:34):
Yeah, I love,

Speaker 1 (26:36):
You could have different, my son who's younger could work on the biggest side. My daughter could work on the next phase. Exactly. Do you have that as part of your, is that in the selection?

Speaker 2 (26:48):
We do. They're not marked as such though. You basically have to search for Cobble Hill. And then I think the front end, the marketing side that you're looking at is actually broken [00:27:00] now. But in the backend we have a custom app where you can go in and see, filter and fine tune your favorites and everything. But yeah,

Speaker 1 (27:15):
As a puzzle expert, how do you feel about the puzzles that are meant to just tor at you totally One color or No, its, or

Speaker 2 (27:27):
So it's weird that I'm running a puzzle company. [00:27:30] I don't like really difficult puzzles. I don't do it for speed. I do it because I honestly do it to connect to whoever I'm talking to. It's a way to, one, do something together, but also not pay attention to your phone. A lot of times, meetings or whatever, someone will get distracted and I find I'm more in tune and connected to the person sitting across from me when I'm doing a puzzle with them. So I'm a 300 or a 500 piece puzzle person.

Speaker 1 (28:00):
[00:28:00] You bring 'em to meetings.

Speaker 2 (28:02):
So we have, and there's one of my PR people keeps pushing me to do puzzle talk, which is like do interviews with someone else and video podcast style. And as we're talking, we are solving a puzzle together.

Speaker 1 (28:20):
Makes total sense. It's like hot ones, but for puzzles.

Speaker 2 (28:22):
Exactly. A hundred percent. And I'm like, I don't know. I'm busy.

Speaker 1 (28:29):
Well, great [00:28:30] to meet you. I appreciate your feedback. You'll get an email about compensation almost immediately. I don't know if July 4th timing, may the payments show up maybe Monday, Tuesday for that stuff. But thanks again. Nice to meet

Speaker 2 (28:44):
You. Yeah, yeah. No, it was nice meeting you too.

Speaker 1 (28:47):
Have a good one. Bye.

Speaker 2 (28:48):
Take care. Have a good weekend.
