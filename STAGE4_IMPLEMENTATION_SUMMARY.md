### 2. Competitive Detection
- Keyword-based competitive theme identification
- Searches quotes and descriptions for competitive language
- Flags themes involving vendor comparisons, switching, etc.

### 3. Theme Statement Generation
- LLM-powered executive statement creation
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for high-quality output
- Focuses on business implications and actionable insights

### 4. Strength Classification
- **High Strength**: 5+ companies, 8+ findings, clear patterns
- **Medium Strength**: 3-4 companies, 4-7 findings, some correlation
- **Emerging Strength**: 2 companies, 3 findings, limited evidence

## Theme Categories
