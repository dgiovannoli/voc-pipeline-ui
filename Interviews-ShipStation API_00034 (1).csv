1. Win/Loss Drivers: Understand why shipping API solutions are chosen, focusing on customer pain points, decision criteria, and competitive advantages (Chris W, 00:04:18-00:06:47; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25; Cody, 00:14:24-00:15:13; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49).
2. Competitor Strategies: Identify competitors’ pricing, use cases, and go-to-market tactics, particularly EasyPost’s enterprise focus and incentives (Chris O, 00:04:26-00:06:30; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:15:29-00:17:12; Aaron, 00:14:48-00:15:24).
3. Pricing and Packaging: Explore how upfront pricing compares to usage-based models and whether it deters prospects (Chase, 00:12:40-00:13:57; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35; Cody, 00:20:22-00:22:23).
4. ICP Validation: Confirm the emerging enterprise and partner ICPs (10,000–100,000 orders/month), including their specific needs and triggers (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Sales Process Effectiveness: Identify gaps in sales motions (e.g., solution selling, responsiveness) that could appeal to potential customers (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Anne, 00:14:24-00:14:42).
6. Customer Awareness and Perceptions: Understand how prospects discover shipping APIs and their awareness/perceptions of ShipStation API and Auctane (Anne, 00:20:47-00:22:49; Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).
2. Commoditized APIs: APIs are assumed to be seen as similar, with decisions hinging on support, documentation, or incentives (Anne, 00:12:57-00:13:26; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:08:27-00:10:16; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25).
3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

I'm based out of Salt Lake City, Utah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:01 - 00:02:02)
Sorry, I just missed you. What did you say?
Emmeline Wang (00:02:02 - 00:02:05)
Oh, I'm based out of Salt Lake City, Utah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:05 - 00:02:11)
Very cool. Very, very cool. Yeah, very nice. Well, I guess it's warmer than where you are. I'm in London in the uk.
Emmeline Wang (00:02:12 - 00:02:15)
Okay. Awesome. Cool.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:15 - 00:02:44)
Very cool. Thank you very much indeed for joining me today. You probably know I'm with Buried Winds. We're a third party research company working with shipstation to improve how they better serve prospects and customers. We're recording the interview I and we're conducting it just to help them basically understand a bit more about their interactions with customers. With your permission, I'd like to record the conversation if that's all right.
Emmeline Wang (00:02:45 - 00:02:49)
Yep, that's totally fine. I'm just going to leave my camera off because my allergies are a little bit rough.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:50 - 00:03:05)
Okay, no worries at all. No worries at all. I'll do the same. That's perfect. So exactly all of this will be used to create a report which will be shared with ShipStation. Do you have any questions before we begin?
Emmeline Wang (00:03:06 - 00:03:06)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:08 - 00:03:12)
No worries at all. Thanks very much indeed. Well, in that case, let's jump right in.
Emmeline Wang (00:03:12 - 00:03:13)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:13 - 00:03:19)
So just to just begin with, can you just briefly describe your yourself, your role and your company?
Emmeline Wang (00:03:20 - 00:03:56)
Yeah. So my name is Emmaline. I work at Alltrails as a social media manager and I run all of our social media accounts. But I also help with our gear team. So specifically around like shipping operations and just making sure like order fulfillment does go through because like whatever comes from social and those purchases. I work directly with our like merchandising gear team because we have like a gear sector where we ship like company merch to external like B2B B2C customers. And so that's like predominantly like where my experience with like shipping logistics comes in.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:57 - 00:04:06)
Amazing. And so on that what kind of challenge or need kind of prompted you to evaluate different shipping API solutions?
Emmeline Wang (00:04:07 - 00:04:42)
Yeah, I think ultimately because we work with Shopify as like our vendor, the main just sometimes difficulty is connecting that with our like our warehousing and shipping. So I think when we were evaluating different shipping solutions it helped us understand like what's the most seamless integration between Spot and Shopify and then also just the other shipping carriers that go through the app directly. So then when we are fulfilling Orders like it directly links communication between our warehousing to software solutions to make it the most seamless and customers aren't receiving their orders late.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:44 - 00:04:51)
That's brilliant. So it helps you basically connect Shopify with shipping carrier and shipping carriers and warehouses.
Emmeline Wang (00:04:52 - 00:04:52)
Correct.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:53 - 00:05:08)
Amazing. And during the process when you're evaluating different solutions, who typically was involved in deciding which solution you take up?
Emmeline Wang (00:05:09 - 00:05:41)
Yeah, ultimately it was with our gear manager, our general store manager for the gear shop. But ultimately all of stakeholders, including marketing within like Life Cycle and also Social had like you know, equal say into making decisions which when we were going to go with because ultimately like there's all these different services that we use for marketing like software wise and we want to make sure whatever stripping solution was attainable was going to seamlessly integrate with all of the platforms that we use within marketing.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:42 - 00:05:51)
That's brilliant. And what's the most important criteria that you use for choosing a shipping API vendor?
Emmeline Wang (00:05:52 - 00:06:33)
Yeah, ultimately came down to just like efficiency and being able to integrate with the most platforms possible because I know there are some that don't really work with like let's say if you're going through Instagram Shopping or Shopify, like Shopify for the most part hosts most shipping carriers and, and APIs. But I think like ultimately it just came down to what was going to fit within like our braze system for Life cycle and you know, Instagram and Tik Tok for social as well that can link directly to our gear shop. But ultimately I think Shopify was like the main one that we want to make sure that there was no miscommunication between like our warehouses where we store our gear to the website and getting fulfillment orders in.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:35 - 00:06:44)
Amazing. And how did you develop your list of vendors? How did you get about and how did you kind of discover them when you were planning?
Emmeline Wang (00:06:45 - 00:07:02)
Yeah, so we work directly with our shipping warehouse and ultimately for them also just being able to assess what solutions fit their needs for making sure that orders are fulfilled. So I was mostly working with our shipping warehouse and vendors to establish a tech API for more of the software side of things.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:04 - 00:07:16)
Interesting. And did they come up with a list or of potential providers and did you and, or did you or did they suggest some names or something similar like that?
Emmeline Wang (00:07:17 - 00:07:38)
Yeah, I mean Shipstation was definitely one of them. They're a big player in the shipping arena you could say. And then yeah, like they provided a lot of the different like API for what works for them as well. So yeah, we did get a list from them and then ultimately like we're still in the decision making process for which one to go with.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:39 - 00:07:51)
Got it. I'd say. So you say you've got a list of potential APIs from your warehouse team. Were they the ones who looked it up? And did you look up any essentially yourselves?
Emmeline Wang (00:07:52 - 00:07:53)
What was that said again?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:55 - 00:08:09)
Did you. And when you were kind of compiling a list of which obviously shipstation was one, you said that the, the warehouse gave you some of the, the names. Did you go and look for any others or have you heard about any others?
Emmeline Wang (00:08:10 - 00:08:25)
Yeah, well, so shipstation was one and then there's like Shipo and then easyship. I think there's like Ship Engine as well. So there was like quite a bit that we had to work with and I think that's what's like right now. We're like evaluating like pros and cons of each.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:26 - 00:08:30)
Got it. And were you. And did you know all of these names before you started or did you look them up?
Emmeline Wang (00:08:31 - 00:08:39)
I had to look some of them. Like Ship Engine, I haven't heard of. I've heard of easypost and shipstation. Yeah, got it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:39 - 00:08:43)
And so you were familiar with shipstation before you started, is that right?
Emmeline Wang (00:08:44 - 00:08:45)
Say that one more time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:46 - 00:08:49)
You were familiar with ShipStation before you started?
Emmeline Wang (00:08:50 - 00:08:52)
A little bit, yes. Yeah, I had an idea.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:55 - 00:08:58)
Amazing. And what was your kind of perception of them?
Emmeline Wang (00:08:59 - 00:09:20)
Yeah, I mean I know that they work with a lot of different vendors and I know that like the thing that was like really attractive to us was like obviously there was a sale on like you know, doing business with them and just knowing that like most of the major carriers are using Ship Station. So I think that was like what is making it appetizing for us to use their service.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:22 - 00:09:32)
Brilliant. And what do you see as kind of its primary strengths and weaknesses based on your understanding aside, some major carriers use them.
Emmeline Wang (00:09:32 - 00:09:57)
Yeah, I mean I think for some it's like just having in some ways a one stop shop. We have up to a certain number of users. I know the one we were looking at was up to 15 users across the company and then it could also help with inventory management and basic warehouse management as well. So having some assistance in that arena was helpful and like a potential pro.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:58 - 00:10:00)
Brilliant, brilliant. Any. Anything else?
Emmeline Wang (00:10:02 - 00:10:18)
I think that's pretty much it specific and I mean I think that's like with every company you have a dedicated account manager, like someone to help you with business success. So that's always nice is having someone a direct contact. But I feel like that's pretty standard across many vendors of course.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:19 - 00:10:25)
And they Were one of the people you considered doing your most recent evaluation, is that right?
Emmeline Wang (00:10:26 - 00:10:26)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:28 - 00:10:34)
Brilliant. And that was because you'd heard of them and any other particular reasons you included them?
Emmeline Wang (00:10:36 - 00:10:46)
Yeah, I mean I think it's mainly just like well known brand API. And also I think it's one of the friendliest integrations with Shopify. Like it just makes it really easy to plug play.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:47 - 00:10:53)
Brilliant, brilliant. And would you consider Shipstation in a future evaluation?
Emmeline Wang (00:10:55 - 00:10:55)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:56 - 00:11:04)
Brilliant. That's brilliant. And I suppose which API vendors have you kind of evaluated and are you aware of?
Emmeline Wang (00:11:06 - 00:11:17)
Yeah, the other ones were easyship and Shippo. Those are like the other two. I know Shippo is another key competitor, so we're just evaluating those options.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:19 - 00:11:23)
Amazing. And so far, what do you think their key kind of strengths are?
Emmeline Wang (00:11:25 - 00:12:04)
I think it's similar. Like I know that there's that seamless API integration, so I think one thing that we're looking at specifically like comes down to cost and like how much volume can they move. But ultimately like, I think volume is not something we're super concerned about just because like we don't, like we don't move a ton of volume. Like we move probably around like a million a year, 2 million worth of product. So I think ultimately it's just making sure that we're able to like get those solutions integrated seamlessly into our workflows.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:06 - 00:12:14)
Brilliant. And what, I suppose what would make, you know, any of these guys really stand out?
Emmeline Wang (00:12:16 - 00:12:22)
I think it comes down to pricing. That's like, I mean, to be perfectly frank, that's what we're assessing.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:23 - 00:12:32)
Right. Okay. Yeah, if that, if that's, I mean, do you think, I mean do you see them as homogenous products and technical features and capabilities or strengths?
Emmeline Wang (00:12:33 - 00:13:01)
Yeah, I was gonna say I really do enjoy both Easypost and ShipStations, APIs and software. I think like just being able to see the volume in which what moves is very helpful. And so I think that's really helpful to have like an additional lens on top of like what our Shopify will present to itself for like the statistics and movement of inventory and revenue drivers.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:02 - 00:13:04)
So is that their dashboarding function?
Emmeline Wang (00:13:04 - 00:13:05)
Correct.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:09 - 00:13:21)
That's really good. Okay, that's really, really cool. And what do you wish shipping API vendors understood better about your company and its evaluation process to make it more effective?
Emmeline Wang (00:13:22 - 00:13:52)
Yeah, I mean I think right now it's just more so understanding like our brand and like what we're moving so that when that comes to the communication between like our online system to our warehouse to the ship station, like, there is nothing that really breaks in between because there's still some manual effort to be done, I think with just like making sure, like, while the API is connected like that the warehouse is also getting the message and they have access to, you know, the shipping and logistics as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:55 - 00:14:06)
And one thing. Can you describe a sales experience with a shipping API vendor that went really, really well or really poorly during your evaluation?
Emmeline Wang (00:14:07 - 00:14:34)
Yeah, I think with shippo we saw there were some, like, software glitches that I just think that it's not quite like what we're looking for specifically around, like, reporting. Like, I think when we showed some of the tabulated graphs when we were the demo, like, it wasn't showing accurate numbers and it was under and under reporting, then reporting accurately. So it's more of like more on the dashboard functionality side of things.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:36 - 00:14:39)
Interesting. And now you said before that was quite an important feature.
Emmeline Wang (00:14:39 - 00:14:40)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:42 - 00:14:49)
Got it. And how would you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value it kind of provides?
Emmeline Wang (00:14:51 - 00:15:08)
I think, like, when it comes to just like all the services offered, like I said, I think easypost and shipstation offered the most robust features for what we're looking for, especially around reporting and the API connection between our vendors.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:12 - 00:15:27)
So it's reporting and connection and API connection, predominantly. Yep. Brilliant. Just one thing. Have you got to the stage of evaluating price, print pricing?
Emmeline Wang (00:15:29 - 00:15:44)
We haven't yet. Like, we're still evaluating features and I know that there's obviously negotiations to be done with, you know, if we sign on with a certain year contract, like, what type of discounts we can receive. So we're still in that phase of just exploring options.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:46 - 00:15:50)
Got it. Do you have any particular expectation about what that pricing is going to be?
Emmeline Wang (00:15:52 - 00:16:06)
Not so far. I think for us, like, we don't want to go in knowing, like, how much things will be a hard set cost, but we're evaluating, like, which competitor would be more working for us financially, if that makes sense.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:08 - 00:16:22)
Absolutely. And I mean, I suppose. Do you have a. Yeah. Any kind of idea of what, you know, in terms of a ceiling or, you know, nice to have have, or is it just going to be the lowest bidder is going to kind of win. Win it?
Emmeline Wang (00:16:23 - 00:16:38)
I think right now it's lowest bidder, but ultimately, like, we're evaluating the software and then like, what is the, like, cost per month and then like, how much would a year contract come out to? That makes sense.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:39 - 00:16:45)
Got it. And cost is the most important criteria, you feel correct?
Emmeline Wang (00:16:45 - 00:16:49)
Because I think both software programs provide, like, what we're looking for.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:50 - 00:16:58)
Interesting. And it's between you and Easy Ship. Is that. Sorry, Between. Sorry. Easy. Easy.
Emmeline Wang (00:16:59 - 00:17:01)
Easy Ship and Ship Station. Correct.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:01 - 00:17:02)
Ship Station.
Emmeline Wang (00:17:03 - 00:17:04)
Yes, currently.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:05 - 00:17:22)

Let me know if there's anything else that we can help with or if you don't receive.
Emmeline Wang (00:17:27 - 00:17:29)
That sounds good. Thank you so much.

Thanks, Emily. I really appreciate it.

Have a great day and great weekend. Bye.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:34 - 00:17:35)
Take care. Bye.

Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).
2. Commoditized APIs: APIs are assumed to be seen as similar, with decisions hinging on support, documentation, or incentives (Anne, 00:12:57-00:13:26; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:08:27-00:10:16; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25).
3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

Raw Transcript:
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:27 - 00:03:27)
Hi David.
David Smith (00:03:30 - 00:03:36)
How'S it going? Ah, can you hear me okay?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:37 - 00:03:39)
Yes, and I can see you as well now. Hi, lovely to meet you.
David Smith (00:03:40 - 00:03:41)
You as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:41 - 00:04:29)
Thank you. Thank you so much for, for joining the the interview. Just to introduce myself, I'm Linda. I'm working basically with an organization called Buried Winds, which is research organization which is currently working with shipstation API to really to understand and improve how they better serve prospects and customers. So we're really learning, working with, to help Shipstation API better understand your shipping API needs. So with your permission, I'd like to record the conversation which we share the recording along with the transcript with ShipStation API. Is that okay?
David Smith (00:04:29 - 00:04:31)
That is okay by me.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:31 - 00:04:42)
Fantastic. Thank you so much. I have quite a lot of questions to get through in this short space of time, so I will plunge into them quite soon. But do you have any questions that you'd like to ask me before we start?
David Smith (00:04:43 - 00:04:47)
Just where you're from? Like your accent, where are you from? I'd love to know a little bit.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:47 - 00:04:49)
Yeah, I'm from the uk. I'm based in the uk.
David Smith (00:04:51 - 00:04:51)
Which part?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:52 - 00:05:02)
I live in Kent in the southeast of England. So it's about 40 miles from London. Southeast of London, Yeah, my life, My.
David Smith (00:05:02 - 00:05:04)
Wife lived in Birmingham for a bit. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:04 - 00:05:21)
Okay, yeah, that's the west side, so I'm on the east side. Birmingham's the. Well, it's the West Midlands area. So yeah, Buried Winds is based in, in the US though, but. But I'm working from the uk. Nice. Okay, so where, where are you based?
David Smith (00:05:23 - 00:05:30)
Outside of Idaho Falls, Idaho Civic, Northwest of Idaho or the us so it's.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:30 - 00:05:46)
Always really interesting to know where, where people are that I'm speaking to. So. So what I'll do then is actually just could I ask you very briefly really for the purpose of the recording as well, just to briefly introduce yourself and your role and the company that you're currently working for.
David Smith (00:05:46 - 00:06:25)
Yeah, no, definitely. So I work primarily with CtW Logistics or Bridgetown Trucking Midwest as a head of business Development, Business development manager over the Midwest. And yeah, my whole role is based off of client acquisition and sales, developing the key accounts and then managing those accounts. And so my accounts range from anything from big and bulky items to small parcel e Commerce Fulfillment. I had deal with a number of clients who ship through FedEx, UPS, USPS and so on and so forth.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:26 - 00:06:53)
Okay, that's really helpful. It sounds like you're a perfect person for me to be speaking to, so that's great. I would say for me, although I'M a researcher, I'm not a specialist in this particular industry area, kind of in operations or logistics. So I may sometimes need to ask you to explain things in really simple terms, you know, so I understand them. So just sounds good that out there. I mean, I had to look up what an API was when I started working on this, so that works.
David Smith (00:06:53 - 00:06:56)
I didn't know what an API was either until about a year ago, so.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:56 - 00:06:57)
Okay.
David Smith (00:06:57 - 00:07:03)
Not, not on the tech side of things myself. We have a team for that. But I do, I do know the, the gist of it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:04 - 00:07:17)
Great. Okay, so then can I start then with asking you what particular needs or challenges have prompted your company to evaluate shipping API solutions, either now or in the past.
David Smith (00:07:19 - 00:07:47)
As of now, it's just the struggle of working with FedEx and UPS. Their customer service is atrocious. That's the main portion because when we do run into an issue, it's extremely hard to get it resolved. And issues seem to becoming more and more frequent with both services. So that's the main gist of why we're open to looking and what's prompted looking in the past as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:48 - 00:08:03)
Yep. Okay. And if you were to go through that process of evaluating potential vendors or solutions, who in your company would be involved in that process? What, what roles either influence or contribute to the decision?
David Smith (00:08:05 - 00:08:20)
Yeah. So it would be myself and then our terminal manager, whose name is Mike Cyrus. And then our president would like to have, you know, some insight into it as well, but the real decision makers would be Mike, our terminal manager, and then myself.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:21 - 00:08:36)
Okay, and what would you say? I mean, I understand you haven't, from what you said, you've not really been through that process as yet, but what would you imagine that the most important criteria would be for choosing a shipping API vendor?
David Smith (00:08:37 - 00:08:55)
Ease of use and ease of integration is number one on all of it. I love our warehouse workers, I love my team, but they're also not the most tech savvy people in the world. And so if they don't have a good ease of use, it's going to be a hard sell for us to say, yes, this is what we're going to use.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:55 - 00:09:03)
Yeah, that's really important, isn't it? And are there any particular features that will come to mind in terms of what would contribute to ease of use?
David Smith (00:09:05 - 00:09:34)
Primarily with the user interface? You know, what they're actually seeing making it so it's not just not complex. I mean this more simple and easy, the simpler it is for them to, you know, they see the screen, the buttons, are laid out very well for them to know. Hey, for this task I'll go into this, this feature. For this task of going to this feature, I think that would be the best and what we would be looking for.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:35 - 00:09:42)
Okay, and then you mentioned into, I think was it integration with the, the other factor that, that you mentioned or.
David Smith (00:09:43 - 00:10:08)
Yeah, ease of integration. So being able to integrate with our warehouse management system or transportation management system, that would be more on the tech side of things. I just know that those integration processes can take upwards of six months sometimes. And so being able to, you know, get those communicating one with each other, you know, within a shorter time frame, one to three months would be, would be big to that as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:09 - 00:10:21)
Okay then, if you were looking to evaluate vendors for shipping API solutions, how would you develop that list of possible vendors to look at?
David Smith (00:10:22 - 00:10:49)
I would use first Google and then I use some sort of AI to chatgpt to look up, hey, you know, who are the top vendors for this? Who are the, the, out of those, you know, who are the top 10 shipping API vendors in the world? I would then go from there and say, okay, out of those, what is the top three? You know, and list our criteria in each of those and, and have the AI tell me. And then I would back it up with my own Google research.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:51 - 00:11:10)
AI can be really useful content in some respects. I have mixed feelings about it because it takes over certain aspects of my role, but certainly it's really useful for questions like that. And what would you be like? I mean, say then you looked at their websites and that was. Is there anything in particular that you'd be looking for that might stand out from websites that would help your comparison?
David Smith (00:11:11 - 00:11:50)
Yeah, ease of getting a demo. I can tell you from other softwares that I've looked at if there is not a simple get a free demo here or look at this demo video or a speak to a representative button somewhere on the website that's easy to find, I will move on to the next. I get very frustrated with that because we're in 2025. It's not hard to create a website that has a couple buttons like that pop out and are easy to click and get you speaking to a real person. Or if they have a good demo video that it would link you to, that also works. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:52 - 00:12:01)
Okay, and now kind of moving on to your perceptions, if any, of ShipStation API. Are you familiar with ShipStation API?
David Smith (00:12:02 - 00:12:04)
Not with ShipStation API, no.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:05 - 00:12:08)
Okay, so you don't have any familiarity at all?
David Smith (00:12:09 - 00:12:11)
Not with them specifically, no.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:11 - 00:12:38)
Okay, so I suppose In a sense, you've answered this. But if you were introduced to a shipping API from a company like shipping ShipStation API, what do you think might make you consider it then for a future evaluation? When you've mentioned about having a demo, you know, is there anything else that you'd feel would really have to figure, you know, that would be there for you to have, for you to even consider it?
David Smith (00:12:39 - 00:13:10)
If they could quickly list the three key benefits to working with them versus their competitor, that, that goes a long way for me. Saying, you know, hey, this is what sets us apart. These three things or this thing, you know, just a short, you know, one sentence listing the three things is, is pretty. I mean, that helps me understand. Okay, now I know these are their key benefits of their key offering. I can understand. Okay, is this going to be a fit right off the bat or know not. And if it's going to be a fit, then we can explore that demo.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:11 - 00:13:32)
Okay, and when in terms of what those benefits might be? I mean, again, I know you've mentioned factors already in terms of ease of use and integration, but in terms of how they, they present that, then if they were to say, oh, this is how we can kind of stand out from our competitors, what, what would you be looking for in any particular types of features?
David Smith (00:13:33 - 00:14:16)
Definitely, yeah. The amount of time that they save clients, on average, that's a key feature that we appreciate because, as you know, I mean, time is money and they correlate really well together. That'd be a key feature outside of the ease of use, of course. And then another one I think would be just how any native integration that they have would be a huge, a huge thing to set them apart, saying, hey, we integrate with, you know, these WMS warehouse management systems, these TMS systems. Now we integrate with a thousand of them or however many it might be, because I know there's literally tens of thousands of systems out there that they could integrate with and so.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:16 - 00:14:34)
Sure. Okay, so then moving on to think about competitors. Are there any other shipping API vendors that I know you've said you maybe haven't actually evaluated, but that you've. They actually looked at and considered evaluating as a solution for the company?
David Smith (00:14:35 - 00:14:56)
Yeah, Heartland is one API that we looked at. Ship Hub was another one that we looked at in the past. I was just coming on to working with the company at that point, so I didn't, wasn't really a part of that process, but I know that they, they were looking at that. So those are the first two that come to mind.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:57 - 00:15:05)
Yeah, Are there any others that you're aware of that come to mind that you may not have actually looked at, but that you can think of?
David Smith (00:15:05 - 00:15:07)
Not off the top of my head, no.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:07 - 00:15:18)
No, that's okay. And those that you or your company did look at then, Heartland and Ship Hub, are you aware of, like, what the key strengths of those vendors were when. When they were evaluated?
David Smith (00:15:19 - 00:16:03)
Yeah, Heartland was their dedicated customer service team, was their, their key key offering, you know, because they offered a lot of the same standard features that, that their competitors are offering. But their standout was our customer service team is, you know, US based. Is, you know, works. I believe it's like 5:00am Pacific Time to, you know, well, after closing now, 7:00pm Pacific Time. So, you know, extended hours. They're available pretty much when you need them, as much use of them as you can. And then with, with Ship Hub, theirs was all based off of integration. Theirs was. Hey, we'll integrate, you know, we can integrate under 30 days with any system that was their, their main key offering.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:03 - 00:16:14)
All right. Okay. And so just to clarify, did, did you. You haven't actually. You're not using any of those solutions at the moment or you are, right?
David Smith (00:16:15 - 00:16:17)
Right? No, no, no, no. Correct. Yeah, we're not using.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:17 - 00:16:18)
You're not using either.
David Smith (00:16:18 - 00:16:38)
We're just using them either, right? Yeah, we just looked at it to see if it would. How they could improve our systems, and our terminal manager just made the decision that, you know, they wouldn't. The, the ROI on it just wasn't worth it for either of those systems. And I don't remember the pricing on them and what it was, but he just determined that it wasn't going to be a fit due to that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:39 - 00:16:47)
Okay. So that was the main reason for not proceeding at that point. It just wasn't. Wasn't worth it kind of in return on investment terms.
David Smith (00:16:47 - 00:16:48)
Correct.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:49 - 00:17:13)
Okay. I mean, were there any other factors that you mentioned there? I suppose, you know, what, what the strengths that you were found to be most attractive or potentially, you know, most attractive if you were to select those. Are there any other factors that really made them stand out or would make any shipping API vendors stand out that you haven't already mentioned?
David Smith (00:17:19 - 00:17:46)
Anything else that would make them stand out potentially? You know, being able to provide rate comparisons across the different markets, that would be nice. I don't think either Ship Hub or Heartland had either of those. Had that. That'd probably be the next. Next thing we'd be looking for is a true. Being able to say, hey, here's a rate Comparison for our clients to see and for us to possibly get a little bit better margin on our, on our partial shipping outbound. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:47 - 00:18:05)
Okay, and so what would be the kind of triggers in future that actually might make you then go back and evaluate API vendors again? Are there any particular developments in your company or future needs or triggers you might anticipate that would cause that to happen?
David Smith (00:18:07 - 00:18:38)
Yeah, a big trigger is going to be just how everything plays out with the tariffs right now. That's a big thing. So we're customs bonded in our facilities and so a number of our clients are looking at bringing in their E commerce and direct to consumer fulfillment into our bonded space. And then if that happens, it's something that we're going to need to bring on to handle that increase in business. It's just an API system that can then help us manage that entire workflow.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:39 - 00:18:49)
Okay, Workflow, I should say. And is that something that you're expecting to happen quite quickly then? If this, this is already a development there in terms of the people that you're working with?
David Smith (00:18:50 - 00:18:55)
Yeah, we should expect to have more information on the 12th of this month. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:56 - 00:19:05)
Okay. All right. So exciting developments I guess, in some ways, but things becoming more complex and busier for you, I guess.
David Smith (00:19:05 - 00:19:06)
Definitely.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:06 - 00:19:33)
Right. Okay. What else do I have here? So in terms of sales and support expectations, I mean you did mention obviously the, the customer service angle. So what, what do you wish that shipping API vendors understood better about your company and its evaluation process? If you're looking at vendors to actually make that more effective from your perspective.
David Smith (00:19:35 - 00:20:12)
Yeah, that we don't need the fluff. I wish they would, they would get that a little bit more that like we're, we're not a, a private equity company that needs all of the, the bells and whistles to be shown to us immediately. We need the, the core fundamentals of what the system we're going to be using is so that we can get the basics down to. Then bring on the fluff later, if you would. I think that's the number one thing that when we're in any demos or looking at any softwares or systems that it's. People get lost in the fluff of things.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:14 - 00:20:18)
So it's like get to the point. What can you do for us exactly?
David Smith (00:20:18 - 00:20:44)
What are the actual things that we're going to be using on this? Yes, I get this one little feature. Super cool, but we're not going to use that. So like what is the, the bulk of what we're going to be using? What does it look like, how does it operate? And giving us some, some use cases in our industry, knowing like, hey, this is, you know, if you don't have a client like that at least researching and understanding this is what a third party warehouse would need it for and could use it for and showing us that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:46 - 00:20:53)
And do you think that's been a weakness in, to an extent. In terms of the vendors you've looked at so far? Have you had that fluff coming across.
David Smith (00:20:55 - 00:21:09)
As far as API shipping APIs go? Not necessarily with them, but with, definitely with other, other software. Especially as it goes for a CRM, a WMS system? Yeah, definitely, definitely for those.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:11 - 00:21:29)
So has there been any sales experience that you've had with a shipping API vendor, either in this role or any other company you may have worked with that actually went exceptionally well or exceptionally badly? Can you think of any examples that you can describe?
David Smith (00:21:30 - 00:21:44)
No, nothing really comes to mind. The last, last demo that we had, sales presentation, I should say, I mean that was probably about a year ago and I just, I don't remember it well enough to, to give any good constructive feedback on that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:44 - 00:22:00)
That's okay, that's fine. What about kind of pricing and value expectations? What I'd like to ask is like, how do you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value that it provides?
David Smith (00:22:01 - 00:22:46)
Oh, that's a, that's a fantastic question. It, where we see it the most is based off the ROI that we'll see from it. So the return on investment. So I mean if, if it's a $10,000 a year system, but it's going to help us either save, you know, $15,000 or save, you know, more than that, or if it's going to help us generate more than that 10,000, then it's something that we're, that's worth bringing on to us, that that's how we value our, you know, whether the expense is worth it. Because if it's going to cost us 100 grand, we're going to put it through the same test. Is it going to, you know, in a year of, you know, first year of having it, three years of having it, you know, when does that, that break even point happen? When do we start getting a good return on our investment?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:47 - 00:22:57)
And do you have views on the pros and cons then of like a pay up front as opposed to a pay as you go pricing structure?
David Smith (00:22:59 - 00:23:32)
Oh, worked it either way with that. We understand both, you know, have their benefits. Some people like the, the pay up front, you know, typically offering a little Bit of a discount, which I know we've, we've taken definitely in the past for something that we're going to invest in versus I know in cases where I'm testing something out, I do like a month to month, even if it's at a little bit of a higher rate to, to truly see, hey, is this something that I'm going to use? Is this something we're going to like, you know, are we going to truly see a return on this? Because if not, then it's maybe not worth using it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:32 - 00:23:45)
Mm, that's, that's helpful. I've also, I've got covered most of the main questions. I'm just going to look back and see because we still have a few minutes and I want to make sure I get as much useful information as possible while I have you the call.
David Smith (00:23:45 - 00:23:46)
100%?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:47 - 00:24:05)
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, sorry, no, maybe, maybe not that. Is there anything else, first of all, that you can think of that we haven't covered that might be relevant to enabling Shipstation API to better understand your possible needs as a company?
David Smith (00:24:07 - 00:25:09)
We touched on just use cases. I mean, I think that's, you know, the, the biggest thing that I, you know, if they're looking for constructive feedback on how to get, you know, more users brought onto their, their systems is, is really, you know, highlighting their three key offerings and then showcasing those offerings in use cases that, from, from live customers. Yeah, like that's. I think the biggest thing is if they can get permission from any of their current customers that are in the industries they're trying to break into and saying this is how, you know, X company has saved or generated or, you know, whether it's time, money, whatever it might be, helps, you know, reduce headache even. I mean, that's, that's a huge thing. I've been, I know for myself, if I can reduce my headache with certain things, I will happily pay for them. So I think we touched on that a little bit, but I would just like to just hit on that again that, that's definitely, definitely what I would recommend they do.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:10 - 00:25:30)
And are there any, like, look, I know you've looked at Heartland and Ship Hub, I mean, from your experience of looking at API vendors, are there any kind of gaps, do you think, in the types of services or, you know, aspects of the tool that are currently being provided that it would be helpful to, to you to have plugged, perhaps?
David Smith (00:25:35 - 00:26:16)
Yeah, gaps in the use cases. I'd say a big thing, big difference between them is the, the integration. Like I said, being able to Integrate with the other systems that we use so our teams don't necessarily have to get retrained on everything. And then the other one, a big gap is just not being able to, to compare rates from, you know, current vendors that they do use, whether it's a FedEx, a UPS, a USPS, anything like that. I know that's a big gap, especially between the two. We looked at between those two that we didn't see that if maybe we did, we would have gone with one of them.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:17 - 00:26:23)
Okay, and do you ship overseas as well, or is it just domestic market that you're serving?
David Smith (00:26:24 - 00:26:29)
We just ship outbound, domestically, inbound. We bring product in from, from all over the world.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:29 - 00:26:38)
Okay, yeah. So is that a consideration as well in terms of how the solution might accommodate international shipping?
David Smith (00:26:38 - 00:27:00)
I don't think so. Our clients don't typically ship internationally from, from where we're located in the Midwest. If we were maybe on a port city, that might be a big difference. But where we're located specifically, I don't think so. I don't think it would, it would sway us one way or the other. If, you know, you had two identical companies and that was the only difference. I don't, I don't know that would necessarily help us choose.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:02 - 00:27:17)
Okay. Like I said, see if there's anything else that I haven't covered. I think it's. They've been incredibly helpful solutions and answers, and you've answered very concisely and helpfully. So we've got through the questions quite quickly, actually. Let me see.
David Smith (00:27:18 - 00:27:20)
I tried to make it short and simple for you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:22 - 00:27:38)
The thing is, we skipped a few questions because you're not familiar with ShipStation. There were a few questions, additional questions that I would have asked that we haven't covered. I mean, have you heard just a couple of names. Have you heard of easypost and, or, and, or Pro Ship?
David Smith (00:27:39 - 00:27:48)
They're Easy Post. Yeah, Pro Ship. I haven't other ones. Shippo. I've heard of Shippo. Easy Post. Trying to think.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:48 - 00:27:56)
Can you tell me, like, any perceptions that you have of either Shippo or Easy Post or any, any others that you might be aware of?
David Smith (00:27:57 - 00:28:21)
Shippo looked like they had the most affordable rates. I didn't do a whole lot of research into to either of them. Watched, I think, a YouTube video that highlighted them. I'll be honest, they didn't have anything remarkable enough to stand out and remember. And I think that that speaks a lot to their systems if they're not rememberable. Right. So. Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:23 - 00:28:45)
Okay. Yeah, I think I mean, that's basically all my questions. I don't want to keep you any longer than we need to unnecessarily, but it's been really helpful. So thank you so much for your time. I understand you'll receive an email from the rewards platform, perform tremendous with payment for the interview, like, within the next 48 hours.
David Smith (00:28:46 - 00:28:48)
Perfect. I appreciate that. Thank you, Linda.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:49 - 00:28:52)
You're very welcome. So that. Do you have any more questions for me before we finish?
David Smith (00:28:53 - 00:28:56)
No, ma', am. I think that's all. Hopefully. Hopefully I was helpful.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:56 - 00:29:02)
Very helpful indeed. Yeah, that. Thank you. And, yeah, I hope you'll get over to Birmingham sometime.
David Smith (00:29:03 - 00:29:14)
I agree. We're. We're expecting our first child here end of this month. It's going to be a daughter, but we're planning a trip hopefully out there at. At some point in the. The next two or three years, so.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:15 - 00:29:26)
Fantastic. Come in summer because winter's terrible. Horrible in the uk. Yeah, fair enough. Hope all goes well with the birth of the new baby. That's really exciting time for you.
David Smith (00:29:27 - 00:29:28)
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:29 - 00:29:32)
Lovely to meet you, David. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
David Smith (00:29:32 - 00:29:33)
Take care, Linda.

5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:11 - 00:03:12)
Hi, Jim, how you doing?
Jim McClellan (00:03:13 - 00:03:17)
Oh, hi. How are you? Drew? Good to see you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:18 - 00:03:21)
It's. It's Will. Not true, but love to love it to be. Oh, you're.
Jim McClellan (00:03:21 - 00:03:23)
You're Will. Got it. Sorry about that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:24 - 00:03:29)
No, that's absolutely fine. I'm Moderator 4. As far as the. As far as.
Jim McClellan (00:03:30 - 00:03:40)
Oh, got it, got it. Good. All right. I know I'm never sure if the person who emails me about the meeting is the person I'll be speaking with. But anyway, nice to meet you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:40 - 00:03:43)
Well, lovely to meet you. Lovely to meet you.
Jim McClellan (00:03:43 - 00:03:46)
Oh, so I was just wondering, where are you physically based?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:47 - 00:03:48)
I'm in the uk.
Jim McClellan (00:03:49 - 00:03:50)
Oh, great, great.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:50 - 00:03:56)
In London. I'm actually, I'm usually in London. I'm staying a place called Bude, which is in Cornwall, if you know it, in the west coast.
Jim McClellan (00:03:56 - 00:04:08)
I know Cornwall. I've been there a couple times. I love, love Cornwall. It's one of my favorite parts of England. I've been out to Land's End and. Yeah, it's just. I lived in London for a year. Just love it. Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:09 - 00:04:13)
Oh, really cool. Really cool. Where are you based at the moment?
Jim McClellan (00:04:13 - 00:04:22)
I'm in. Just north of San Francisco in Marin County. Just if you are familiar with the bay area, about 15 minutes north of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:23 - 00:04:30)
Okay, cool. Very, very nice. Oh, lovely. Very, very nice. It must be a lot warmer there at the moment.
Jim McClellan (00:04:31 - 00:04:40)
It's actually not so bad here. We've been luckily sort of exempt from the heat wave you may have been hearing about that's spread across.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:40 - 00:04:41)
I have, yes.
Jim McClellan (00:04:41 - 00:05:09)
Eastern part of the US it's been, you know, mid-70s or so. Perfect for, you know, for the activities that my kids like to do, like swimming in the bay and stuff like that. So it's, it's really been, you know, a pleasant change from the horrible fluctuations that we've had in weather. And so, yeah, I'm hoping that it can continue and not, you know, scorch us too badly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:10 - 00:05:46)
No, absolutely, absolutely. Well, Jim, thank you very much indeed for joining me today. So basically what we're going to do today, we're just going to run through a quick couple of questions on your recent evaluation with Shipstation. I'm with Buried Winds, you probably know we're a third party research firm working with Shipstation API to improve how they serve their prospects and customers. DMT is being conducted to help them basically learn a bit more about your needs. With your permission, I'd like to record this conversation, if that's all right.
Jim McClellan (00:05:47 - 00:05:48)
Sure, that's fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:48 - 00:06:03)
Absolutely perfect. And the recording and the transcript will be used to basically create a report that will be shared with shipstation just to help them kind of learn and grow. Any questions I can answer before we begin?
Jim McClellan (00:06:06 - 00:06:26)
No real questions from me, I just, no, I just sort of thought, you know, I, to the extent that I can help provide, you know, commentary and hopefully maybe some insights that will help with this. I was happy to respond to the email last week. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:26 - 00:06:36)
Yeah, amazing. Okay, that's awesome. That's, that's brilliant. Thank you very much indeed. So just start. Would you be able to introduce yourself, your role in your company?
Jim McClellan (00:06:37 - 00:07:34)
Yes, I'm Jim McClellan and I am the co founder of Fort Systems F O R T. We are a, we're basically a SaaS model. We're a, a fulfillment and shipping platform. Not terribly unlike shipstation itself actually. But we, we tend to, we focus number one on a specific industry which is beverage alcohol. So we basically enable three PL fulfillment and shipping for companies that store and ship mainly wine out on behalf of their clients who are wineries. So we've built in a lot of sort of industry specific functionality into our three plus SL WMS platform. And so it's that process and we've been around for a while. We're about, you know, we're over 20 years old, believe it or not.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:34 - 00:07:35)
Wow.
Jim McClellan (00:07:35 - 00:07:40)
Yeah, we, we've been doing it for quite a while, but yeah, that's what our software platform does.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:41 - 00:07:51)
Amazing. Absolutely brilliant. And what challenges or needs prompted you to evaluate a shipping API solution?
Jim McClellan (00:07:53 - 00:09:35)
Well, so we are, and I can speak either. As you know ourselves, we're the software platform provider, but we work of course very closely with our core clients who themselves are three PLs. So it might be more helpful if I answer as if I'm a 3 PL, in other words, as if I'm one of our clients who is actually the one who's doing the printing of the label and the, and the pick and pack and shipping. So they all need APIs for multiple reasons really. The main reason is for getting order data from OMS platforms or order management system platforms. Platforms like Shopify or Commerce 7 or a host of others. Bottle360. And so all of that data needs to come to the place that's printing out the shipping label for the package. Right. So all of that needs to come there. And it's the most efficient way to get that data in is through APIs, of course. And then once the label is printed at the warehouse or 3 PL or wherever, sometimes even at the winery itself, that data needs to be sent that tracking number. Data needs to be sent back to the order management system that the client themselves, you know, that the company that took the order needs to access. Right. So. And in some cases that data is made available to the actual consumer so they can see the progress of their package. Right. And that's all done through APIs.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:37 - 00:09:53)
Brilliant. Now, just to. Just to kind of adjust the elephants of the room, are you. So you telling me you do. You didn't actually actively evaluate the solution yourself? It was a customer of yours that need had. Had a need for one.
Jim McClellan (00:09:56 - 00:10:30)
Yeah, So a lot of our customers, some of them actually use ShipStation, some, you know, just use WMS platforms. But so, yeah, we basically help them evaluate these different platforms that can help address their fulfillment and shipping needs. But they're already using our software. Right. So yeah, we're very familiar with all of the shipping solutions out there. Basically.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:32 - 00:10:51)
Got it. So did you. So have. Okay, but you haven't recently kind of evaluated tipstation for potential use. And are you. And have any of your customers, do you know of any of your customers who've recently done that?
Jim McClellan (00:10:53 - 00:11:21)
Yeah, there was a customer, it was about eight or nine months ago actually, that looked at ShipStation. And so we actually were able to log into ShipStation and see the interface and what would be required and the sort of operational flow in terms of getting data in. So, yeah, I assume that's why I was contacted about this.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:23 - 00:11:44)
Got it, got it. Okay, thank you. Thanks very much indeed. I suppose this might, this is, this, this question is probably more designed for someone who has recently done this, but who's typically involved, involved with weighing up, evaluating shipping APIs solutions at your company or let's say at one of your customers companies.
Jim McClellan (00:11:47 - 00:13:30)
Well, it would be typically a team of people, but the two main members of the team would be the person who is responsible for strategic direction of the company, which would be probably me in our company's case. And then the other person would be the CTO or CIO or whoever is chiefly responsible for or technical development or integrations with other platforms. And so both of those people would be deeply involved. And so API integrations are, needless to say, they aren't really an option anymore. They're really required if you are going to be operating in this space. So the question is, really isn't so much are we going to do this? If you're in this business of providing shipping or needing shipping almost now, by definition you are involved in API exchanges of data. So the question is, how efficient is this API, how much is it going to weigh on our servers? How heavy is it? In other words, how often does it. Is, is this going to ping our server? How many data fields are actually required? You know, how much of a, of a load is this going to be for us, you know, going forward with all the other APIs that we have?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:31 - 00:13:36)
And do you think those are the most important criteria for choosing a shipping API vendor?
Jim McClellan (00:13:39 - 00:14:51)
I think that's certainly those would be in the realm of very important criteria. The other I think would be, of course, the range of information that's actually captured in the API. Some APIs, for example, don't cover delivery attempts or so in other words, the API simply grabs the tracking number from the shipping platform. And once that tracking number is provided, that's the end of the story as far as the order management system goes. So the order isn't of course complete until the package is actually delivered to the recipient. So that sort of thing really needs to be covered in an API. You know, was there a delivery attempt? Did it fail again? What happened subsequently? Was the package returned to the shipper? Was, is it at a FedEx hub somewhere? What's the current status of that package?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:52 - 00:15:12)
Got it. Really, really interesting. Okay. Very, very cool. And what kind of specific reporting or analytics features do you say you or your customers need from a shipping API to support your business operations?
Jim McClellan (00:15:13 - 00:17:47)
Well, there are two ways to answer that, I think. One is, you know, the very general and I think probably obvious data that you would get from the, you know, in terms of data analytics, like how much volume am I shipping? What's my volume by state, what's my volume by order type? You know, by order type, I mean in the wine industry, a good percentage of orders are, are basically what they call club orders, or they're, they're sent out on a regular basis every month or every other month, as opposed to daily orders that just come in and need to be picked and packed that day or the next day. But then in terms of data analytics, there's an unlimited amount of data that is becoming more and more important. Like, for example, like users of shipping platforms want to know how many returns they're getting, right? The returns are of course, very expensive and very problematic, especially in the line industry where the value of the product is so high and it often cannot be returned. So you data and analytics helps the shipper understand what the causes of returns are, how their incidence can be reduced, thereby saving money for the shipper. And it can also help look at patterns that might emerge in Returns like, oh, it looks like we're getting a higher percentage of returns for packages that are shipped second day air on a Thursday. Now why is that? And so you can drill right down through data that you get through APIs and just arrange it in an intelligible, you know, layout for an analytics component of your shipping platform. But yeah, all that data is critical for shippers who are focused on efficiency and reducing to the greatest extent possible the returns. And of course there are other reasons for returns which data analytics can help as well. The most obvious example there is bad addresses. So if an address is undeliverable, that data can be returned in the API and it can be fixed in the database. Right there.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:49 - 00:17:58)
A question just around it. Is ShipStation something that you'd consider integrating into your own TMS system?
Jim McClellan (00:18:01 - 00:19:21)
Yeah, we certainly would. Actually we are integrated with, with some other shipping platforms. Our, our objective, as I said at the outset, we're, we are a, at our core we're a WMS slash three pl, you know, fulfillment and shipping platform. But really we are, we see ourselves as a, as a shipping data hub. And so there are companies that will not use Fort for their shipping needs. They might use ShipStation, they might use another wine industry shipping solution. There are current users of our platform that don't ship with FORT but nonetheless our objective is to basically provide as rich and as meaningful a data set for those users as they possibly can. Our focus is on the world of shipping and the various complications that are contained within that world. So whether, whether they ship, you know, with the for platform or some other one that's, you know, we're, we're. So I, this is a roundabout way of answering your question, but yes, we are open to integrating with any shipping platform.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:22 - 00:19:31)
Got it. Are you familiar with ShipStation? And obviously I know you are. What's your kind of perception of them?
Jim McClellan (00:19:32 - 00:20:59)
I think they do a great job frankly. They are the leader. I mean, I don't know this technically, I'm just guessing, but I think that they are the leader in, you know, web based shipping solutions. They are in dozens of industries. They are, you know, everywhere you look ships, there's someone using ship stations. So I perceive them as a, as a very, you know, sort of rock solid but, but also sort of basic shipping platform that many users can get at a very reasonable price. I think they've advertised prices as low as like $29 a month or something like that for the basic sort of, you know, relatively small number of packages that are shipped out every month. But so really any company that ships is going to look at shipstation as a platform to manage their shipments. So my perception of ShipStation is that they have, they have cornered that market extremely effectively. They're, they basically, I, we would, we, our company would never want to compete with shipstation for that particular segment of the market. And by that segment I mean the very general, you know, very low priced, you know, sort of no frills shipping label generator solution.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:00 - 00:21:04)
Got it. And what do you consider as their strengths and weaknesses?
Jim McClellan (00:21:06 - 00:23:02)
I think their strength is that they have a very, I mean they probably have multiple strengths, but my perception is that their main strength is that they have a very clear and easy to navigate UI. So anyone can basically become a ShipStation customer. Anyone that's remotely familiar with how the Internet works. It's very easy to get set up and started with a shipstation solution. So that's the main pro. I think no one's going to be, well, very few people will be intimidated and not understand how shipstation works on the, I wouldn't call it a con, but from our perspective what shipstation doesn't do is, and you could argue it's a good idea for them not to do it, that is do what for example, our company does, which is really dive deep into a single industry. And so our warehouse solution, it addresses the multiple points of complexity that the beverage alcohol industry, you know, mandates. So no product can be shipped unless you know the alcohol percentage, for example. And you've got to know all the states have different rules on what specific types of products can be shipped, what specific kinds of entities can ship those products. And they, those rules vary by state. So it is an utter mess. So wouldn't use shipstation for something like that, but, but for shipping. But there are wineries, to get back to what I said earlier, that use Shipstation, but they use it for, you know, they might have merchandise in their tasting room, T shirts and olive oil and food that they ship out from their own tasting room. And they use ShipStation for that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:02 - 00:23:27)
Right. Huh. That's pretty helpful. Thank you very much indeed. Okay. And I suppose did you, when you last referred them to a customer or considered partnering with a third party, did you consider Ship Station for that?
Jim McClellan (00:23:30 - 00:24:26)
So the instance I was referring to about eight months ago that it turns out they were actually looking for a WMS solution. So no, for that we did not. They ended up not using ShipStation, although they saw the great benefit of Shipstation, but they really needed sort of deeper WMS related functionality. However, for wineries like the one I just mentioned, where they actually will use ShipStation in the tasting room. We often would recommend a solution like ShipStation for that purpose. If they're shipping just products that are not regulated merchandise or food or whatever, they can very efficiently manage that with ShipStation.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:26 - 00:24:38)
Okay, and would you consider integrating them into your own platform? Just as a first question.
Jim McClellan (00:24:41 - 00:25:42)
We would, yeah. We would certainly consider an integration with ShipStation. We, meaning for. We also have, you know, as I said, we're. We're chiefly a WMS3PL platform, so we have loads of functionality in embedded in there. We also have a streamlined version of our. Of the platform which we call Fort Ship, which. Which gets closer to what ShipStation does. It's. It's designed for self shippers, by which I mean companies that ship their own product out to their customers. But that's a. Even. That is really different from what shipstation does because it's, it's much more. It's still deeply focused on the wine industry. It just doesn't deal with things like inventory. So a lot of the heavier parts of a warehouse system are ignored by FORT Ship. But still. So that would be a much more expensive product for a winery than Ship Station.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:45 - 00:25:51)
Very interesting. And similarly, likewise, would you recommend them to one of your customers if they were looking?
Jim McClellan (00:25:53 - 00:27:01)
Sure. If a customer of ours were looking for a shipping solution from, say, their own tasting room for not shipping wine, but for shipping all the other merchandise, then shipstation would certainly be on the table for them. And yeah, we would be. So in that case, they were on Fort for their warehouse. It would be helpful for us to be integrated with shipstation. We've actually presented to a few winery. One in particular, I remember in the East Coast. I think they were in Virginia. They were a relatively big winery that used Ship Station to manage their shipments of wine. So I'm not suggesting that wineries don't use Shipstation for wine. It's just that when they do that, they need other systems to manage the compliance aspects of shipping wine. Right. It's not embedded in the shipping solution. And so that winery, I believe, is still using ShipStation. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:02 - 00:27:04)
Yeah. Very interesting.
Jim McClellan (00:27:05 - 00:27:05)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:06 - 00:27:10)
Which other shipping API vendors have you evaluated or are you aware of?
Jim McClellan (00:27:13 - 00:27:19)
We've. Let's see. We're quite familiar with shippo.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:20 - 00:27:20)
Yep.
Jim McClellan (00:27:21 - 00:27:58)
Which I'm sure you know, and there are, you know, OMS platforms that we're integrated with that also are integrated with Shippo. Thinking specifically of Commerce 7. A lot of their users use Shippo. And I should know this. I'm not sure, But I think Commerce 7 also has an integration with ShipStation, so they may have clients that use ShipStation also. So we're one of a number of integrated partners that they have. But yeah, so we've. I would say Shippo would be my main answer to that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:58 - 00:27:59)
There are many others.
Jim McClellan (00:28:00 - 00:28:07)
There are. I mean, gl. Well, no, they really aren't like Shippo. That's probably the best example I can come up with.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:07 - 00:28:11)
What are the key strengths of the vendors you consider the most competitive?
Jim McClellan (00:28:13 - 00:29:30)
I would say similar to what I mentioned a minute ago. I think it's the. The biggest strength, based on customer response that we've seen in our 20 years is, yes, ease of use, very simple, intuitive UI people. And I'm kind of stating the obvious here, but customers respond much less to detailed, powerful, complex functionality, much less favorably to that than they do to very basic functionality that's presented in a very simple, easy to use ui. I've seen that time and time. Again, that's something that we know well because we tend to be more like the former. We tend to be very detailed and complex because our industry demands it. But, but really what customers consistently look for is, is simplicity and ease of use and easy ui. So I'd say that's definitely this. The strength that consistently wins over customers.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:31 - 00:29:38)
That's really cool. Thank you very much indeed. So it's, yeah, easy use and intuitive AI.
Jim McClellan (00:29:39 - 00:29:41)
Right, okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:45 - 00:30:00)
Brilliant. And I suppose there's a similar question to the last one, but what factors would make a shipping API stand out to you? Stand out? I suppose.
Jim McClellan (00:30:03 - 00:31:48)
I'd say, I mean, aside from the, you know, robustness and security of the API itself, that. That's a given. Right? That goes without saying. But. So we. Once that's established, then it's the degree of comprehensiveness, I would say, of the API. And so we're maybe not a great example because again, our industry is so detailed. Our APIs contain hundreds of fields because we often need that. You know, if a package is shipped with, for example, a case of wine with 12 different bottles in it, each of which has a different alcohol percentage, all of that data needs to be discreetly managed in the system. So for reporting purposes, every single one of those bottles needs to be identified and reported with the accurate ABV alcohol by volume information. And so, yeah, it's, I mean, that's just a simple example, but that sort of thing. So we need not only to know what products are every single package, but what components of every single product are in each package and the compliance repercussions of every single one of those. So we've got, you know, a huge range of fields in our APIs, but when we see, you know, a partner company that is able to manage all of that data, that's a great sign for us. So the more robust the API, the better from our perspective.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:48 - 00:32:05)
Got it. And what do you wish shipping API vendors understood better about your company and your company's customers and it's kind of process of evaluating them that would make it more effective?
Jim McClellan (00:32:08 - 00:32:16)
Yeah, what do I wish they understood.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:17 - 00:32:23)
Better about you so that if they have a pitch to you, they get it right.
Jim McClellan (00:32:23 - 00:32:37)
I guess, I mean, that's a good question. And I guess my immediate answer would be that they understood the nature of the industry that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:37 - 00:32:37)
Yeah.
Jim McClellan (00:32:38 - 00:32:51)
That we inhabit, which is that by necessity it requires a degree of detail and complexity that isn't negotiable.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:51 - 00:32:52)
Right.
Jim McClellan (00:32:52 - 00:33:05)
So it's not like we're deciding to be complex. And so it's like other regulated industries like pharmaceuticals or medical devices or, I don't know, cannabis or whatever. Right.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:05 - 00:33:07)
So that's pretty good example. Pharma.
Jim McClellan (00:33:07 - 00:33:45)
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you can't just put something in a box and ship it to anyone. You got to verify where it's going, verify the age of the recipient, verify that they are eligible to receive this particular product, do they have the right prescription, etc. Right. So you've got to. There are. So that level of complexity obviously affects the APIs. So understanding that right off the bat would be something that maybe I would suggest as my answer to that question.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:47 - 00:34:14)
Brilliant. Thank you very much. Those are all of my. Those are all of my, my questions, Jim. So thank you very much indeed for your time today. So you'll receive an email from the rewards platform. Tremendous. With your payment within the next 48 hours. Is there anything else that you wanted to add before the end that. About Shipstation or potentially working with them or any any further thoughts?
Jim McClellan (00:34:18 - 00:34:35)
No, nothing really, other than the same sort of general comment I've had about ShipStation, which is that they are, I think they're widely recognized and respected as the leader in the, in the price tier that they dominate.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:36 - 00:34:36)
Right.
Jim McClellan (00:34:36 - 00:35:29)
So, yeah, I mean, basically everyone who. Any company that looks for a shipping solution is going to include Shipstation in their analysis. And so they are everywhere. They've done a great job with positioning themselves. And so, yeah, we would be very interested in talking to them about some sort of integration where in cases where their current clients might have a need for a WMS platform that deals with you know, a greater degree of complexity. Yeah, but, yeah, so, so, yeah, they're, they've done a great job. And, and I think our, you know, all around the world. I'm sure there are many shipstation users in the uk, Right?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:31 - 00:35:34)
No doubt. Absolutely no doubt. Yeah, yeah.
Jim McClellan (00:35:37 - 00:35:37)
Great.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:37 - 00:35:42)
That's fantastic. Wonderful. Jim, thank you very much indeed. Really appreciate your time and speak soon.
Jim McClellan (00:35:43 - 00:35:46)
Thank you, Will. Yep. Great. All right, well, thanks again.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:46 - 00:35:48)
Lovely. Lovely speak to you. Take care.
Jim McClellan (00:35:49 - 00:35:50)
Bye. Bye now.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:35:50 - 00:35:51)
Bye.

Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).
2. Commoditized APIs: APIs are assumed to be seen as similar, with decisions hinging on support, documentation, or incentives (Anne, 00:12:57-00:13:26; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:08:27-00:10:16; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25).
3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

Raw Transcript
Buried Wins Moderator (00:00:46 - 00:00:54)
Hello, Inga, can you hear me? Hello, how are you?
Inga Holmes (00:00:55 - 00:00:56)
Good, how are you?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:00:56 - 00:00:59)
Very well, thanks. Very, very well indeed. Where are you calling from today?
Inga Holmes (00:01:00 - 00:01:02)
I'm calling from home in Dallas.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:03 - 00:01:11)
Love it, absolutely love it. I'm in, I'm in the UK at the moment. So much less warm than Dallas.
Inga Holmes (00:01:12 - 00:01:12)
Do that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:14 - 00:01:16)
Very much. How's your week? How's your weekend?
Inga Holmes (00:01:17 - 00:01:25)
Good, good, good. Just hot. It's, you know, good 36 degrees Celsius here so it's, you know, it's summertime.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:26 - 00:01:29)
Oh, love it, absolutely love it. Really, really cool.
Inga Holmes (00:01:29 - 00:01:40)
Well, we don't, but it's okay, really. Well, you know, it's just an oven so it'll be nice. Hopefully in October it'll start to cool down.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:01:41 - 00:02:33)
Fair enough, fair enough. Well, lovely to meet you. I'm Will. I'm one of the interiors from the from Buried Wind. As you know, we're a third party research company and we are just want to hear a bit more about your experience with Shipstation from your recent evaluation. I've got a couple of questions and all of them are going to be basically helping Shipstation improve what they do and how they serve customers in the future, which I'm just going to run through with you. If you have any questions at any time, please just let me know. And if anything's not clear, etcetera, just let me know. Just one thing to let you know. The. The call is being recorded so that we can as a part of report to give Shipstation. Is, is that okay with you?
Inga Holmes (00:02:33 - 00:02:35)
Yes, it is. So fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:35 - 00:02:43)
Absolutely brilliant. Wonderful. So I'm just putting up the list right now and we'll be able to take it from there.
Inga Holmes (00:02:43 - 00:02:45)
Okay, wonderful.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:02:47 - 00:03:00)
So just whilst we get started, sorry, apologies, my system's being a little slow. But just whilst we get started, will you be able to tell you me a bit about yourself and what you do?
Inga Holmes (00:03:01 - 00:03:04)
Yep. I'm the Senior Director of Logistics and Trade Compliance for the Fossil Group.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:06 - 00:03:22)
Wonderful. Absolutely perfect. Thank you very much indeed. And I gather you were recently evaluating Shipstation and other particularly vendors. No, you weren't? That's very interesting.
Inga Holmes (00:03:22 - 00:03:28)
No, I was contacted but no, we haven't recently evaluated Shipstation.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:30 - 00:03:42)
Interesting. Okay. And I suppose have you been, have you recently evaluated a shipping API solution either? Now, recently in, within the last couple.
Inga Holmes (00:03:42 - 00:03:55)
Of months, we have not been shopping for that type of offering because we have existing capabilities and so certainly just, you know, how do I say it? No, we have not been shopping for it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:59 - 00:04:11)
That's interesting. Maybe I. Okay, that's very, very interesting. Sorry, I've been on. I was under the impression that you guys had evaluated either Shipstation or a couple number of other vendors as part of the solution.
Inga Holmes (00:04:12 - 00:04:13)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:13 - 00:04:14)
Do you have any.
Inga Holmes (00:04:15 - 00:04:17)
We have existing solutions in place.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:18 - 00:04:18)
Okay.
Inga Holmes (00:04:20 - 00:04:23)
But no, we have not been shopping for that type of offering.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:25 - 00:04:36)
That is interesting. Okay, let me see if I. Let me just check the list of questions because if that's not the case, then maybe it's basically sacred time and. And so on.
Inga Holmes (00:04:36 - 00:04:53)
Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, I know, I get it. Absolutely. I mean, how do I say it? I'm very familiar with those types of offerings and, you know, certainly I'd be happy to give my perspectives on behalf of that topic and. But yeah, no, we have not been recently shopping for it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:55 - 00:05:10)
Okay, interesting. So I'm just looking through the questions to make sure we can actually proceed before we go any further.
Inga Holmes (00:05:10 - 00:05:10)
Yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:20 - 00:05:24)
Okay. And. But you have a. You have a. Currently have a vendor in place, is that right?
Inga Holmes (00:05:25 - 00:05:28)
Yeah, I mean, we definitely do API feeds with vendors. Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:30 - 00:05:37)
Interesting. Okay. And I suppose what made you set that up? What kind of challenges made you look for one in the first place?
Inga Holmes (00:05:39 - 00:07:31)
So I think from an industry perspective, you know, again, we're not shopping, but certainly, I think what I have noticed is, you know, every vendor that does this type of offering and service and you know, feed is usually very narrow to the mode. Right. It's either small package or it's this service or it's that service. And what I think is lacking in the industry, and maybe Shipstation intends to fulfill that gap. So if you think about it from a shipper's perspective, we have stuff going out the door every day, Right. And it's a variety of stuff. Right. Some is small parcel, some becomes ltl. And then of course, people have full truckload. And what I. Because each of these vendors are offering just for that particular small segment of the service, there doesn't appear to be any intelligence behind those offerings to automatically shift modes from an economical standpoint. So if I had, you know, I don't know, let's call it 100 cartons, and I in my mind think it should go small parcel because of where it's going to. There's no offering that says, hey, wait a minute, when you hit that 110th carton, you really should go through this LTL provider and have some intelligence behind it. Now Shipstation is intending to look at that on a broader scale. I think there's a huge opportunity to offer something that is, you know, agnostic across all modes and do that intelligence for you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:33 - 00:07:52)
We might come on to that later on, actually. That's really helpful to know. Thank you. I suppose a question that gave my mind is what, I suppose what is the core problem or need that you have to actually get a solution like this in there in the first place?
Inga Holmes (00:07:53 - 00:09:52)
Well, it's not a problem, but it's an opportunity. It's a cost savings opportunity. Right. You don't really have a problem because you're functioning and you're operating, but it's probably not financially the most optimal solution that you could have. So anytime you have these kinds of offerings, you need a good business case to show, if course, the savings that this will generate. Right. And depending on the intelligence of the WMS and the TMS that these companies use and how it's determining the optimal mode, I mean, really, the savings is always in the freight cost, right? I mean, that's the bill that you're paying and that's what you want to pay less of. Right. So in order to do that, you know, unless you're really dysfunctional and you're not operating well, that's a whole nother story. But most are, most are operating well, right? They're just not operating, operating optimally. And so if you can show the value and the benefit of the optimal mode usage and there is that opportunity, then I think you've got something worth selling. But there are other companies out there that obviously do the. You know, we'll pick this small parcel provider over that small parcel provider because the rate over here with this company is cheaper than the rate in that company. Everybody's already doing that, right? So unless you have something that's special and better than the others that are, let's say, picking carrier A over carrier B because of the rates, I think people have already solved for that type of thing. I don't, not that you can't sell it, but I think you're, you're, you've got a tapped market, so to speak. I think it's when you start solving people's things, opportunities that no one else has solved for. I think that's when you start finding a niche for yourself that says, hey, we can do something that nobody else can.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:53 - 00:10:08)
And I suppose is that first person first. If you were going to evaluate a shipping API solution, who'd be the person doing it? Would it be you? Would it be a bunch of guys across the thing?
Inga Holmes (00:10:08 - 00:11:01)
Yeah, no, yeah. I mean, we would, we would explore. I mean, I have, you know, support people that would do the number crunching and all of that, but I think, and, and be careful about the word API. Right. I think from your tech side, the use of the word API makes sense to you because it's like this great thing. It's an API feed, it's not edi, it's not the other side, it's the latest and greatest. But people on my side at the desk really don't care, like what version of tech you're using. Right. It's a feed, it's a feed of data, it's a push versus a pull. Right. I mean, it's a pull versus a push. Right. And so, I mean, how do I say it? I think API, most people understand that it's a form of data transfer. It's not so special. Right. It, I think it sounds, but it's not that big of a deal.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:02 - 00:11:07)
So what is the most important criteria for choosing a shipping API?
Inga Holmes (00:11:07 - 00:11:34)
Vendor optimization. I mean, you want to, you know, how do I say it? Be the solver of not just the carrier A versus Carrier B option. And which makes sense because that's really what I think. Correct me If I'm wrong, ShipStation is trying to do it saying, hey, I'm going to look at all these carriers and I'm going to pick the optimal route or the optimal carrier for that movement. Right?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:35 - 00:11:50)
Okay. And yeah, exactly. Beyond that, what's, I suppose what is the most important? I mean, so the optimization is great. What beyond that is the most. I suppose what are the most important things that you'd look for?
Inga Holmes (00:11:51 - 00:11:55)
Well, it's a cost versus cost and time trade off.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:56 - 00:11:57)
Yeah.
Inga Holmes (00:11:57 - 00:12:53)
So I think it's assumed nowadays that because of the Amazon effect, everyone just wants everything overnight. And the reality is, is most people don't even know the value trade off of that decision. They just think they need it and they want it because it has to be, because that's the new thing. But the reality is overnight deliveries were in existence before Amazon ever came along. It's actually nothing that new. It's just been rebranded as a special solution. So what is the cost trade off of time and money? Are you really ready? Because in these days and times with, you know, the financial, you know, hardships of many companies, do they really understand that you could save X if you just slowed it down by one day? I don't know, can you tell that story?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:55 - 00:13:09)
Fair enough. And what kind of specific reporting or features, analytics, that kind of thing do you need or want from a shipping API kind of business or a solution?
Inga Holmes (00:13:10 - 00:13:24)
I would. So I know a lot of people want dashboards and reports and data and mining and all of that, but it's because their heads are stuck in the past of that's how you got answers to questions, right?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:24 - 00:13:25)
Yeah.
Inga Holmes (00:13:26 - 00:13:39)
How about I don't go hunting for questions to answers? How about you tell me the intelligence behind my network and the things that I don't know about myself that I need to know.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:42 - 00:13:56)
I like that. So it's not just, you know, allowing you to go, you know, rootle through your data and find answers, it actually proactively says you should look at this, you should optimize this, etc.
Inga Holmes (00:13:57 - 00:16:07)
Yes, absolutely. I mean, we're so programmed, especially people in these roles of my age. I mean, I'm 57. It's not a secret. And we are so used to our old ways of working, right? And so we feel the need to have the data so we can do the old way of what we've been doing. But the world is changing, right? And no longer do we need to do that digging ourselves. And most of the time we're probably not going to have the perspectives that we should because again, we're thinking from our past. So what we really need is somebody smarter than us or something, a tool that is picking up on things. And maybe it's just a series of golden nuggets. Give me a golden nugget every day. Things that, you know, did you know this is what's happening in your network today. And then you can accumulate those golden nuggets into larger nuggets that on a monthly basis show trends and patterns, that it's not just today. It happened, you know, 20 days in a row and sort of shifting with the behaviors of your network. Because every week, every month, something will shift and change. And by the time you figure it out, it's already been months. Unless something prompts you and tells you that this is happening. And you can then go, oh, and then, by the way, then I want the tool to do something for me about that and tell me what it did. I mean, I really do think that autonomous supply chain capabilities are certainly very, very capable and possible of today's technology. It's the human beings in the seats and the roles today that are preventing that from happening. Because if, if the technology makes all those observations and decisions for us, then what do they need us for anymore? Right? Just saying.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:07 - 00:16:16)
And fair enough. And how do, how do you develop your list of vendors when you're evaluating a different solution?
Inga Holmes (00:16:18 - 00:17:05)
So I look at the humans, it definitely rolls back to the human beings. I'm really not interested on how long They've been with the company or whatever experience they've had. I'm looking for human qualities that are matching my values. I want transparency. I want honesty of what you can and can't do and, you know, opportunities where, you know, you've learned lessons and failed. Maybe a bit. I, I want to know the human on the other side of that vendor name. Because at the end of the day, a vendor name is nothing. Right. It's the human beings that I'm dealing with. And are we speaking the same language in terms of the qualities and values that we both believe in?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:06 - 00:17:27)
Absolutely. And, and if you were going setting out from scratch to develop a list of people you want to speak to before you get to speak to the humans, as it were, how would you go about sourcing the companies? Would you, based on, you know, would you Google a list? Do you have a good idea of who the vendors are already? How do you find who you can speak to?
Inga Holmes (00:17:29 - 00:17:57)
So again, because the world is changing so rapidly, I hate to say it, but, you know, I know, for example, when I've shopped for tmss before, all of a sudden you hear these other names and you're like, who are these people? You know, and then you're like, oh, wow, they're real players. Right. So it's really hard to keep up with who's who in the marketplace. And really, I, I hate to say it, but my technique would be doing a variety of Google searches.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:57 - 00:17:58)
Yeah.
Inga Holmes (00:17:58 - 00:18:20)
With different, like, you know, word mixes and trying to see who pops up consistently. I do want. I'm not going to probably be interested in a startup. Right. I need somebody that's been around for a bit because I can't afford for, to take a chance on a startup that has been around for a year or two and then disappears on me.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:20 - 00:18:21)
Yeah, of course.
Inga Holmes (00:18:22 - 00:18:28)
So I need, you know, probably I would say I need somebody that's been around for at least five to 10 years.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:30 - 00:18:32)
And are you familiar with Shipstation?
Inga Holmes (00:18:32 - 00:18:33)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:34 - 00:18:36)
No. Never heard of them.
Inga Holmes (00:18:36 - 00:18:36)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:37 - 00:18:49)
Got it. And if you introduced to a shipping API from a company like them, what would you make it make them? What would make you consider them for kind of a future evaluation?
Inga Holmes (00:18:51 - 00:19:52)
I'm always interested and open to hearing new ideas and new approaches. And I'll give you another analogy. There's a company called Veho and they're different. Right. Their approach is different. Now we don't use them. We still chose not to use them because they're still not competitive for our needs. But their story is very interesting because they're taking a opposite approach of what a traditional provider is taking. So I always am interested to hear about those, you know, what makes you different type of story. And again, I believe in, you know, learning about the leadership of the company and you know, what is their motivation behind the offering? You know, are they, you know, just here to make a buck or do they really have passion in what their, you know, what their creation is?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:53 - 00:19:58)
Love that. That's awesome. Which ones have you heard of? Which kind of vendors in that space.
Inga Holmes (00:19:58 - 00:20:55)
Have you heard of besides Ship Station? I mean, you know, so obviously the main big providers that, you know, do stuff, I haven't shot for that stuff in a while. Let me try and think, I'm trying to remember the names but let me just do something real quick because I wanted to see something about who you're playing with in that space and because really, how do I say it, you know, it's. What is the name of it? Just one second. I mean it's Station. Let me just see something real quick.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:56 - 00:20:57)
That's okay.
Inga Holmes (00:20:57 - 00:21:36)
It's been a while since I've had to look for that kind of stuff. Easy Ship I've heard of. Yeah, and of course, I mean an easy post, of course. And Pitney, of course. I don't know, do they, do they still offer that product? Because they're gone, I guess from a carrier standpoint. But there's. Are they still offering the software?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:41 - 00:21:43)
That's cool. Which one do you use?
Inga Holmes (00:21:45 - 00:22:48)
So we are a single, we use all of our small parcel with FedEx. So really we don't use one because we are a singular user of FedEx. And you know, we have not, like I said, we have not shopped for this type of offering. When we have looked at the, the rates that we have and the volumes that we have, we felt like it's a pretty good leverage deal that we have. We have a very long term relationship and with FedEx and so we, we look at things probably not as much on a transactional basis as many companies do. And then also the trick behind this is in the WMS environment, how you adapt the WMS to create the labels and when it's changing carrier carton by carton.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:49 - 00:22:50)
Okay.
Inga Holmes (00:22:50 - 00:23:18)
That's the trick. We're on a very old version of Manhattan. So it would have to be, I mean, somebody would have to show us some pretty good money that says you would really save, you know, quite hundreds of thousands of dollars to justify, justify the change to the wms because it's going to cost us to Change that WMS to make it nimble to that type of offering.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:20 - 00:23:33)
What. I suppose bearing that in mind, what would you perceive some of these carriers strengths to be of the ones you think are kind of offer a competitive offering?
Inga Holmes (00:23:35 - 00:25:08)
I think it's the, you know, everybody can move a package when times are good. I think when times are tough and then, you know, you get into peak season or whatever, of course they, they cannot distinguish your package from somebody else's, from a delay. I mean, it's impossible, right? They're not capable of that. They're not gonna go, oh look, this is a fossil box, we better move that one. That's not going to happen. But when it comes to some strategic decisions that they choose to align with a company and really we stick by each other through thick and thin when we need, when we have a problem operationally and we say, oh my gosh, boy, that sale went crazy today and you know, I need an extra X loads because you know, they don't even blink. Right. Whereas some others might go, I don't know, it wasn't forecasted and I don't know. You know, I think, I think that's the thing is we stick by each other through thick and thin. Neither of us are perfect and, but I think the commitment to each other is on a very personal level and it's not just between me and my sales rep. It goes up and down the chain, you know, on multiple levels that if, if we have a question or we need help, my boss, my, my SVP can pick up the phone and, and contact his equivalent and there's just this connection.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:09 - 00:25:09)
Okay.
Inga Holmes (00:25:10 - 00:25:27)
And, but again, money does talk. Money does talk. So if there is a bunch of money on the table and they can't touch it, we would make a change, I guarantee you. Because there's, there's that it's just too much of a challenge these days with all the tariffs to turn down good money.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:28 - 00:25:42)
Okay, and what do you think that some of the guys you named, like Easy Ship, Easy Post, that kind of thing? How, where do you think they're strong if you've ever looked into it?
Inga Holmes (00:25:44 - 00:26:59)
I mean, I think we've, we've sort of briefly, you know, said oh, what would that look like? But the, the trade off of our leverage deal versus breaking it apart and allowing that tool to do its thing and using their agreements or us even doing side agreements, it just, it never, it didn't beat what we have, basically. Okay, so I'm sure that they're good, I'm sure that they're fine. I think they have to have a sweet spot. If you're in a larger volume space, it's almost like you have to be small or really big to have the value of. When you're really big, you would still have your own agreements with those providers for certain volumes. But then the tool can work. It's magic. Right. If you're in a very small place and you can't, you don't have enough volume to get your own agreement, then that tool of course takes care of you for that. I think we're in the middle. We're not really huge, we're not really small. So I think that's why we just haven't seen the value but always available to look at it again.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:59 - 00:27:15)
That's great. And I suppose what would make a. I mean, we obviously mentioned the proactive intelligence previously, but what other factors might make a solution kind of stand out in your view?
Inga Holmes (00:27:16 - 00:27:19)
I think if the solution went beyond the box.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:20 - 00:27:21)
Yep.
Inga Holmes (00:27:22 - 00:27:57)
So tell me some intelligence about my customers. Tell me some intelligence of, of things that people are buying that's inside the box. Go beyond the box. I mean, you can get that data in the feed. Obviously very doable. Right. It's not just one package with dims and weight and you know, from. And two, you can get the contents of the box. You can get the destination of the box. Right. So now tell me about that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:58 - 00:27:59)
Yeah, because tell me about the customer.
Inga Holmes (00:28:00 - 00:28:16)
I think a lot of times people, there's, you know, a variety of companies have customer intelligence tools or not. I'm just saying. So how can you tell me about my customer, about what's happening with my product in real time terms?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:17 - 00:28:31)
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And just one more. And just what do you wish some of these vendors understood better about your company and its thinking and evaluation process that would make it more effective?
Inga Holmes (00:28:32 - 00:28:57)
They need to, just like we want to learn about the human, they need to slow down and stop the sales pitches and make a decision to make a commitment with a relationship and learning about that human being first. I mean, I know you got to do the sales. I know you got to do that. You know, let me show you what I've got. But how about we get to know each other first?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:59 - 00:29:03)
Is that what shipstation didn't do? Did they ever get in touch with you?
Inga Holmes (00:29:03 - 00:29:03)
Nope.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:03 - 00:29:08)
No. No. Really interesting. Really, really interesting.
Inga Holmes (00:29:08 - 00:29:28)
Not that I know of. Or at least if they did, it was never memorable. I mean, I don't remember anybody from Shipstation, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it was in my inbox. And I just, you know, I, I try and I try and respond to people, but sometimes I miss it. So maybe they did and I just don't remember it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:28 - 00:29:45)
No worries. Thank you very much indeed for your time. Those are all my questions. Thank you very, very much indeed for your time today. So you'll, you'll get an email from within the next like 48 hours or so from the rewards platform. Tremendous. Regarding your payment. Thank you very much indeed for your time.
Inga Holmes (00:29:46 - 00:29:47)
Can I give you just one piece of advice?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:47 - 00:29:48)
Please. Yeah.
Inga Holmes (00:29:48 - 00:29:52)
Yes. The reminders are excessive.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:54 - 00:29:56)
So for this particular platform.
Inga Holmes (00:29:57 - 00:29:58)
Yeah, for the call.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:00 - 00:30:06)
I will relay that, I'll relay that I got like.
Inga Holmes (00:30:06 - 00:30:24)
An email at 6 o' clock this morning. Your calls in four hours. And I'm like, I think I've been reminded like five times. And how do I say it? I'm a professional person. If I make a commitment, I stand by it. I know that they have to try and honor, you know, make sure that people show up. But I'm like, okay, this is way too much.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:26 - 00:30:30)
Thank you for letting me know. I will pass it on, of course.
Inga Holmes (00:30:30 - 00:30:54)
And, and I'm happy also, you know, if the ship station people want to just reach out to me, I'm always happy to help people. Sometimes even for not, you know, a fee or whatever kind of thing. I, you know, just try and give back a little bit sometimes. So if there's ever any type of, you know, they want to reach out and ask me some more questions or anything, just give them my contact. I'm feel I'm happy to talk.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:55 - 00:30:57)
I will do. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Inga Holmes (00:30:58 - 00:31:00)
Absolutely. Thank you.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:00 - 00:31:03)
Sure thing. Lovely speak to you. Take care. Bye.
Inga Holmes (00:31:03 - 00:31:05)
Okay, bye.

1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).
2. Commoditized APIs: APIs are assumed to be seen as similar, with decisions hinging on support, documentation, or incentives (Anne, 00:12:57-00:13:26; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:08:27-00:10:16; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25).
3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

Raw Transcript:
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:28 - 00:00:29)
Hi, Todd, how are you?
Todd Brower (00:00:29 - 00:00:32)
Hey, Drew. Doing very well. How are you?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:32 - 00:00:35)
Good. Thanks for making time today. Yeah, no problem.
Todd Brower (00:00:35 - 00:00:39)
Thanks for having me. Beautiful guitar on the, on the wall there.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:39 - 00:00:51)
Thank you so much. I wish I, I got to play it more, but I, I have, I got it in high school. I saved up kind of my, all my, you know, part time jobs and, and got that. Do you play?
Todd Brower (00:00:53 - 00:01:21)
You know, I probably have the same story as you. I played all throughout like middle school, high school, college, and then I still tried to play as much as I could. Had two kids and I feel like I don't pick it up as much, but my kids are getting old, a little bit older now. They're 10 and 7. So I feel like I, I gotta like find time and bring it back. I can still play, but it's like, you know, it's been so long, like the muscle memories there. But yeah, I gotta get back into it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:22 - 00:01:25)
I feel the same way. Mine are seven and four.
Todd Brower (00:01:25 - 00:01:26)
Okay. So.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:26 - 00:01:38)
And I was, I was a minute late because they, they start school on Wednesday here in Texas and so they're home though with a babysitter for Monday, Tuesday. And it's, it's. It's parenting with kids at home sometimes. I'm sure you. Yeah, it's.
Todd Brower (00:01:39 - 00:01:48)
No, totally. Yeah. My, my. I'm lucky that my, my two kids are in camp right now, but the other, the one of them was sick last week, so we had to have. You know how it is.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:50 - 00:02:20)
Well, let me give you context for the call. My name is Drew Giovanoli and I run a research company. And what we do is help companies like Octane or Shipstation learn more about their customers, their buyers, people who didn't go with them, people who did. All in the aim of improving the way they serve their customers and earning the business of new prospects. And so, with your permission, we'll have about a 25 minute conversation. It's recorded, but only for use of ShipStation API internally to improve. Is that okay with you?
Todd Brower (00:02:21 - 00:02:22)
Yes, that's fine.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:22 - 00:02:33)
Great. And let me just make sure I have some details correct. To start, I have you as a VP of Operations@meritbeauty.com. is that correct?
Todd Brower (00:02:33 - 00:02:34)
Yes, that's correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:34 - 00:02:49)
Awesome. Well. Well, if you don't mind, I'd love to just start by having you introduce yourself. And I have the title, the name of the title, if you describe kind of your responsibilities there and tell me a little bit about the company.
Todd Brower (00:02:50 - 00:05:07)
Yeah, sure thing. So to kind of step, take a step back because I feel like it's helpful as I kind of tell my story of how I got here. So went to college for engineering. I found myself in contract manufacturing kind of world. So contract manufacturing beauty products. Didn't go to school necessarily for that, but it's just like what happened. So I worked for two different contract manufacturers for beauty products where I worked on the floor. I kind of knew the ins and outs of like how to make a beauty product in general. And then after about eight years of that, I went on to the brand side. So I was basically like the operations person for a marketing LED brand. So I've done this now four times. So I've been with four different like beauty brands, but every time I've kind of been the operations guy. So the operations guy usually deals with the contract manufacturer, the distribution, the warehousing, you know, you're dealing with the direct to consumer person and also B2B things like Ulta and Sephora. So you're basically like the technology and operations guy for these beauty companies that like develop cosmetics, they develop hair care products, etc. Etc. So I kind of act as that bridge between people that are not very knowledgeable in like distribution and operations and then partnering with like a warehouse or with like an IT team. A lot of times it's like consultants. So I'll like kind of bridge that gap between people who are like bringing NetSuite on board and attaching it to the software system, the, you know, the WMS of the warehouse company, et cetera, et cetera. So I've done that for a couple different brands, went through a couple different acquisitions. And now with Merit, for the past two years, I have a team of like six people. And I do everything from dealing with the manufacturers, which are global, and then dealing with the warehouses, which we have three of them and we'll actually have a fourth one by the end of this year. So we have a pretty good global distribution network. And each one of the warehouses uses its own like DTC software to ship things in the best way. And they also each one of them ship to a various Sephora distribution center. So I head up that team at Merit.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:08 - 00:05:10)
Sound like a perfect person for this.
Todd Brower (00:05:10 - 00:05:19)
Yeah, that's what. When I got your thing, I was like, I probably will be able to fill up your time and answer a lot of questions appropriately.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:20 - 00:05:40)
I appreciate it. The starter question I have after the context is just simply what the companies you've been or across your brands. What are the challenges or needs that prompt you to evaluate kind of new shipping solutions or new shipping API Solutions, things that trigger or motivate change.
Todd Brower (00:05:42 - 00:06:20)
So I mean the thing that motivates and changes the most on like what I normally do is usually expansion. So like you start with an American company, they expand into Canada, then they usually like expand into like Australia or the uk and then all of a sudden you're in the eu, then you're in the Middle east, then you're in Southeast Asia and it's like, it's this constant expansion which triggers us to do something. So for instance at Merit, like our path was to start with an American warehouse and they used their various software to be able to ship all over America. Now when we did that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:20 - 00:06:23)
Sorry to interrupt you, but are we talking about some 3PL?
Todd Brower (00:06:23 - 00:07:37)
Yeah, 3PL warehouse. Yes. So they use various softwares and shipping partners. So we had like, we used FedEx for a while, then we were using DHL and now I think we use a combination of DHL 3D max. Well a combination of three things. We use like DHL 3D max passport for like international stuff and then CDL, which is like very, very cost effective and fast but like only for the east coast. So it's important that like as we're expanding we're finding these three PLs that like can do all these things because you know, everybody can usually ship stuff, but can they ship it quickly? Can they ship it, you know, with a, with a cost reduction in mind or like a fair cost? And can they also handle like specialty things? So for instance, I'm a, I'm a beauty brand and we sell a perfume, we sell fragrance. So it's Hazmat. So I also need like the warehouse and the shipping abilities to be able to handle that kind of stuff. So anyway, to answer your first question, I think it's what causes us to look at these things is expansion into new territories and also expansion in like product line. So for instance like Hazmat and stuff.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:37 - 00:07:56)
Like that makes sense. Is it you solo looking at these solutions or do you have do other people within, I don't know, the technology team and the operations team, like who makes up the decision core that makes the final decision.
Todd Brower (00:07:58 - 00:08:36)
So I would say it's between myself and the one of the people that works for me. So my person is a director of logistics, for instance. So she's on my team and she is in charge of like all warehousing and freight. So she's like the person who would end up sourcing it, finding the solution and then, and then probably working with me and then my boss who's the cfo. Ultimately we would want to go to him and be like, does this make sense on a per order basis? You know, average order is $100. It costs $6 to ship it to California. Like does this make sense? So it's really those three people. So I'm kind of in between the sandwich there.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:37 - 00:08:44)
Sure. What are your criteria when you go to look for a shipping API vendor?
Todd Brower (00:08:45 - 00:10:31)
So it's if it's so shipping API. I'm assuming you mean like the software like that the warehouse would be using. Yeah, yeah. So a lot of it is like availability of like for instance in Europe. We want to make sure that it can ship to all European countries. I don't want to be using a software that can only do, you know, it does like France and Spain and Netherlands very, very well. But like has a hard time with, you know, Norway and Sweden or whatever. Right. Like for me as being like a smaller growth company, I would rather have like okay, this software encompasses everything. I want to make sure they can ship to all the countries. I want to make sure that it has an ability to like price rate. So I wanted to like shop the rates and get like the best costs available. So a lot of times it doesn't make sense to just go with one provider. Like for instance, for us like we use DHL 3D max mostly in America, but we have a price a rate tool embedded inside of the warehouse that will say okay, mostly three day max makes sense. But if it's a hazmat item it's going to go FedEx ground. If it's on the east coast it's going to use cdl. And if it's going to like Canada, it's going to use Passport. So it also needs to have like all these different things that it can rate shop within it because we don't necessarily want it to just like pick one vendor. We want to be able to have that variability. And then for international context, I think the more it can do the better. Again, if it's just like a hero in one sec in one category of the world, I think that that isn't great. Like we'd rather have something that can shop right everywhere.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:32 - 00:10:51)
Yeah. Tell me about the relationship with the warehouse and three pl. When you have an order comes in, are you guys managing those choices yourself or is it all pushed to the warehouse to figure out and you trust them to make a budgeting decision and you just pay through them?
Todd Brower (00:10:52 - 00:11:49)
So we just pay through them. So our orders all come into Shopify. We just push the orders Straight into our warehouse WMS system. And then they do all like the shop rate, the, the, the rate shopping and all that kind of stuff. They do it within their system. So they come to us if they want to change out their software and we happen to be I think like the number two largest company within our current warehouse, for instance. So they come to like their top three brands and say like, hey, we want to do this thing and then we'll say like yes, that's a good idea or not. So for instance, like the shop, the rate shopping for like using CDL and stuff like that. Like we, they came to us and asked and we said yes. But yeah, all of that comes into the warehouse and then the warehouse basically uses their own system that decides like what uses what carrier and et cetera, et cetera for like the best price. So they do that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:50 - 00:11:55)
Can you share what WMS system you are using today and what kind of warehouse 3pls you're using?
Todd Brower (00:11:56 - 00:13:00)
So we use NetSuite. So we use Shopify. That goes into NetSuite and then NetSuite is connected to everybody else through Soligo. So that's like just the connector we use. We utilize a warehouse. We, we right now have two warehouses. One is Capacity, so they're in North Brunswick, New Jers. They have another like satellite in the UK and then we use Shipbob in Canada. So we utilize them and we basically trust them enough for them to like use their own softwares. I, I think both of them are homegrown softwares. Like I think Capacity has their own WMS system and shipbob I'm assuming is the same. I think it's like their own system. But like as far as like when they shop for rates and stuff and they use, you know, a fulfillment company, like you're saying like Ship Station. I think they decide whether they're using it or not. And I don't know, I don't know if Ship Hop uses shipstation or not. I felt like they had said something like that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:01 - 00:13:09)
I know that they have a partnership. I don't think it's exclusive, but I think in some cases it is used.
Todd Brower (00:13:09 - 00:13:21)
Yeah, yeah. So I think they, so our, our Ship Baba relationship is actually brand new. We're using them in Canada and we, we just started that. So yeah, I think they used that kind of software.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:22 - 00:13:43)
Got it. Are there certain reporting or analytics you get back from these WMS systems about the shipping choices and the costs and like I'm sure coming through that shipping API. Whether they use ShipStation API or anyone else?
Todd Brower (00:13:44 - 00:14:48)
So capacity uses a software system that they're just rolling out now called Enveo I believe if you heard of Enveo before. I have not, so I hadn't either. But they're using this software and it's supposed to give us the shipping costs, the transit times, all that kind of stuff in a nice downloadable report. I haven't seen it work correctly yet but my person, the director of logistics, she's actually working on that to like give us like monthly reports so we can see like costing and stuff and basically see like did it make sense to use CDL and did it make sense to use you know, dhl? So we're using ENVEO there and then the UK warehouse I think is also going to use nvo and then I don't honestly know what Ship Bob is going to do for reporting. I'm assuming they have their like own reporting system but they're still pretty new. But we've been using the capacity system for quite some time. They had their own like reports and they realized it wasn't enough. So they're using Inveo now.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:48 - 00:15:08)
Interesting. Those both seem like NVO seems like a third party tool on top of the existing ws, probably on top of a shipping API or tool that's new thing and it's going to rest on top and gives you visibility into all of it.
Todd Brower (00:15:08 - 00:15:17)
Yes, I believe that is true and it is simply yeah, like a reporting software that sits on top. It's not actually doing anything, it's just gathering all the data and producing reports.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:18 - 00:16:11)
Yeah, yeah. We are on the earlier stages of this research with ShipStation API and I imagine we're going to run into a lot of scenarios where vendors are focusing on hey, how are we going to get this out, how are we at the store and how are we going get this out which is our warehousing and logistics first? When do you think in your opinion a brand will engage and interact with a making shipping decisions like hey, a solution. So we're going to go use ShipStation, they're going to choose to intentionally use Substation and then partner versus going straight to the 3 PL. Is it just a matter if they have their own warehouse or not? Or are there situations in which they would use it otherwise?
Todd Brower (00:16:11 - 00:18:09)
Yeah, so I would say brands that are started are kind of divided into two different categories in my mind. The first one is a completely D2C brand that starts just direct to consumer. So that could start at like in someone's basement or someone has like a, a shop that in their town where they're like starting a brand inside their shop and they're like literally shipping stuff out of their shop and they have like a pickup every day of like 10 to 15 orders or something like that. So I could see like someone utilizing something like that in the back of a, the back of a store or even at like, your house. Like, I, I don't, I don't know how Shipstation is utilized, but if you can like download the software on your laptop, you can get a scan gun, you can literally like print labels. I think like a small brand could do that. Once you get past though, like having to do, let's call it 20 orders a day, it's just like too much for a person. So usually you find your way to like a 3PL and then a 3PL kind of handles everything like that. So I mean, you could bring like, you could be, you could say something like, I use Shipstation. I want you to use it because, like, I already have been doing it and I already like, am familiar with this. Um, so I could see like, like that happen. Um, but I think a lot of brands that have like a store and they have like a back room or a person that's starting a brand and they have like a basement and they're like trying to start something could probably use that and then, and then bring it. Our brand, for instance, didn't start that way. We started with like a capital injection and had money and we went straight to a warehouse and we also went straight to Sephora. So we kind of bypass that piece in like our brand history. So our kind of brand would probably go straight to a warehouse and say, you know, whatever you have, as long as it's good rates and you get the job done, I don't really care. But I think people who like, started in the beginning probably would. Would care more and if they had a physical space. Right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:09 - 00:18:20)
Cool. Slightly different line of questioning. Are you. Were you Even familiar with ShipStation and ShipStation API? Before receiving our email and us talking.
Todd Brower (00:18:20 - 00:19:12)
I think I heard shipbob talk about it or so. So I will say, do I in general know about them? No. However, though, in the past like four months, I've gone on a lot of warehouse tours because we're, we're expanding where we just finalized our Canadian warehouse and we're expanding our European warehouse. So I've been on so many warehouse tours, I'm pretty sure multiple people have brought up that they use something like ShipStation. ShipStation is also a very generic name. So I Don't know if I heard like ship something else or something else Station, but I'm pretty sure I heard of a couple warehouses using Ship Station and then like you know, showing us how it worked and et cetera, et cetera. So I just like, I think I have heard of it but I don't think I directly am using it unless Ship Bob is in which case I am sure.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:13 - 00:19:50)
And I heard from you pretty clearly if the rates are what you need and it works, kind of irrelevant to you, but did you have any perception of. I guess it sounds like you had heard of the brand, right. Octane or Shipstation who, who owns them? Sounds like they were speaking to them as a here's a feature functionality. So it'd be in a positive light. It's like check out what we can do. But there was no perception of kind of strengths or weaknesses or why you would use it or not, correct?
Todd Brower (00:19:50 - 00:19:55)
Yeah, no, it was just like people use it, not that it was bad or good.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:56 - 00:19:56)
Sure.
Todd Brower (00:19:57 - 00:20:05)
I think people, people would say it in a way of being like oh we use this like more well known thing. So like you're in good hands.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:05 - 00:20:06)
Got it.
Todd Brower (00:20:06 - 00:20:07)
But yeah. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:10 - 00:20:27)
Is there anything you wish that the 3pls or some of the ship station knew about your business or which is in. In general do to better serve you? What do you think? Kind of that whole market is lacking in terms of supporting a business like yours.
Todd Brower (00:20:28 - 00:22:24)
So from a brand's perspective, a couple of the pain points for us is that like for one no one has really good rate cards on like below a pound and we a lot of times will like ship a lipstick or we'll ship like one little thing and we don't really have good like breakdowns of like okay if it's 6 ounces or 9 ounces and whatever. Like a lot of shipping like starts at a pound and goes past that. So it'd be great to have like better rate cards for that and then also like dim out weights and stuff like that. Like sometimes it's really hard to manage between like all these different vendors that have different pricing for different sizes and different volumes and blah blah blah. So the, the pricing piece is sometimes hard on a brand because you're not comparing apples to apples when you look at different things. So I think in general like it would be nice. And Shipstation probably like already does this and probably our 3pls already does this. But like as a brand I see a lot of like different rate cards that are like different things in different zones and etcetera Etc. It would be nice to have like a software just tell you like, here's the best pricing that you're going to get for these types of carriers and here's the best pricing you're going to get for these types of carriers from like 2 ounces to 4 ounces to 6 ounces to 8 ounces, like all those little in betweens. Because we, you know, I have it right here. We have like, you know, tiny, tiny little products. Right. And I can put them in tiny little boxes and that kind of stuff. Like I think too many times it's just an assumption that like the item, like the, our smallest box is this size, which is like quite a big box, so to put like a little lipstick in that. But, but it doesn't really matter because our, our, our sizes get dimmed out. So anyway, I think from the brand's perspective there's just a lot of like variables when it comes to pricing and sizing and stuff. And it would be nice to have that be like way more condensed. Condensed and clear.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:25 - 00:22:29)
I heard you say this phrase, the pricing gets dimmed out. I'm not familiar with that. I'm sorry.
Todd Brower (00:22:30 - 00:23:20)
So it might, it might just be like slang in the, in the industry. But like dim. Dimmed out means like the dimensions of the box. So basically the box is so big in such a way that like it doesn't matter what the weight is anymore. The, the weight is, or the, the price is calculated on the box size instead of the actual weight. So that's something that also like, is difficult for us because like it makes sense to have a larger box when the items actually like doesn't weigh that much. So there, there's this, you know, it's probably just me complaining also because like I sell small things, so I'd rather, I wish my boxes could be smaller and like save a lot more money, but they kind of don't. So that, that's something that like we're looking for is like carriers to be able to take like much smaller things and give us price discounts for it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:21 - 00:23:48)
Yep. You've done this so many times. I'm sure you go into these three PLs, you've got a pretty good idea what things should cost. You're probably rate shopping also. How, how do you come at it? Do you have a price per item or. You know, obviously size and weight all matters, but how are you making that kind of pricing assessment on the cost to ship something?
Todd Brower (00:23:49 - 00:25:11)
So for our brand we're always trying to get it to the customer as soon as possible, within reason, but like, next day. Shipping for everybody is unreasonable. Right. It costs too much money. So we're always trying to find, like, a happy medium in between. We want to, like, give the customer the best possible experience, but also within, like, a reasonable amount of money. So do you. Usually the way that we look at it is that we look at like, an average order. So let's call like, our average order is a hundred dollars. We usually allow like, you know, 5%, 4% for shipping, and then you have like, the shipping materials and blah, blah, blah. So basically, like, we look at it as. Okay, so for America in general, most of our people are buying from the west coast and the east coast, so we want to find a shipping mechanism that is the most fair for both and also gets it there in like, similar time and for a similar price when you do an average. So, so for us, we're trying to always find that happy medium and we're trying not to go with like, the, the very cheapest possible way. And then you end up, like, not getting to California for like, seven days. So it's, it's a balance. I don't think there's like, an equation. Yeah, but, but it's a balance. We're trying to, like, keep costs down, but make customers, you know, as happy as possible.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:12 - 00:25:17)
And roughly how many shipments are you guys doing a month?
Todd Brower (00:25:19 - 00:25:22)
So we do between like a thousand to three thousand a day.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:23 - 00:25:26)
So yeah, so let's.
Todd Brower (00:25:28 - 00:25:32)
Yeah, so, yeah, so something like 60,000 orders a month. Something like that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:32 - 00:25:51)
Yeah, sure. Let me look through my questions to see if there's anything I missed. Is there anything that you thought that I'd ask you about that? I haven't. We're early on the research, and so sometimes early research informs later research. What do you think that you should know?
Todd Brower (00:25:52 - 00:27:19)
Well, I'm making an assumption that I know what shipstation does, which is that it's a software that a, you know, WMS or that, that a warehouse would use to, like, you know, which, like, different avenues to go. But, you know, I think it's always like, a good question to ask, like, what else should they incorporate into their, like, offering? Right. Like, if the software does this, like, what else should it do? So again, I, I don't know exactly what this software does. Besides, I'm assuming, like, Rate Shop and like, create, you know, the ability to, like, ship things out for a warehouse. But there's definitely, like, little additional things, like, it could do. Like, if it's a hazmat product, it will put Together, like different kinds of forms. Like, I would be curious, like, how does it do customs and like international shipping and stuff like that? Like, if I utilize ship station, like, what can it really do? Can I just do like really good North America stuff? Could we actually ship to Europe? How does it handle? Yeah, customs clearance, how does it handle? Like all these other things. So like, so for someone like me that is in charge of the operations of a growing brand that's like expanding globally, I'd like to know, like, okay, so list me all the things that you do and when are you going to do these things? Like can you ship to Asia? Um, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:19 - 00:28:00)
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I think the core of the business is the ability to manage incoming orders, determine the best price for the best location, generate those actual shipping labels because they're partnerships with USPS, DHL, FedEx, and then batch print them for, for shipments that are coming out soon and then, you know, track the fulfillment through, through the full delivery cycle. And I think it's used by a lot of the three PLs too. If they're getting goods in and out onto trucks, they're managing the relationships with the carriers to get the best price in, in the fastest capacity based on the needs of the goods.
Todd Brower (00:28:01 - 00:28:02)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:02 - 00:28:02)
Cool.
Todd Brower (00:28:02 - 00:28:03)
Makes sense.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:04 - 00:28:06)
Thank you so much for your time, Todd. It was a pleasure speaking with you.
Todd Brower (00:28:06 - 00:28:11)
Yeah, you too. So will you just, I guess, send me an email through my personal email and.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:11 - 00:28:34)
Okay, whatever email you sign up for or you sign up for the call with, you'll get a follow up email within 24 hours. Usually faster than that. And it comes. Compensation comes as a, as a, through tremendous. And lets you take it as a donation, a gift card, or even a direct payment. Okay, cool. Thank you so much, Todd.
Todd Brower (00:28:34 - 00:28:35)
All right, thanks, Drew.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:35 - 00:28:36)
Bye bye.

Raw Transcript:
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:41 - 00:05:45)
Hello. Hello Alec. Hello. Hi. How are you? Good.
Alex Kazickas (00:05:45 - 00:05:45)
How are you doing?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:46 - 00:06:40)
I'm good, thank you. Thank you so much for, for joining me. Really appreciate taking the time to, to do this interview today. So I have quite a lot to cover in, in just half an hour, so I'll plunge right into the questions very soon. But first of all, just a few preliminaries first that I need to go over before we actually start the actual interview. So basically I'm working with Buried Winds, which is a third party research firm which is currently working with Shipstation API to improve how they serve prospects and customers. So we're basically conducting the interviews to help Shipstation API find out more about your shipping API needs. Sure. And with your permission, we'd like to record the conversation if that's okay, which we will share the recording along with the Transcript with ShipStation API. Is that okay?
Alex Kazickas (00:06:40 - 00:06:41)
Sure, yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:42 - 00:06:46)
Thank you. So do you, do you have any questions before I start?
Alex Kazickas (00:06:47 - 00:06:48)
Just. What's your name?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:48 - 00:06:50)
I'm sorry, my name's Linda.
Alex Kazickas (00:06:50 - 00:06:51)
Linda, you got it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:52 - 00:06:54)
Yeah, sorry, it's a bit anonymous the way it comes up.
Alex Kazickas (00:06:55 - 00:06:55)
No problem.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:56 - 00:07:20)
And what I would say is that I'm a researcher but I'm not a specialist in this area of operations. So I will, I might ask, I might ask some silly questions as you to just explain things in really basic terms. I had to look up what, what an API was when I. That's my level of knowledge. So if we can kick off Jeet, can you just very briefly introduce yourself and your role and, and company?
Alex Kazickas (00:07:20 - 00:08:24)
Yeah, definitely. Linda. My name is Alex Kazikis. I'm the Vice president of operations at Primary Kids. We're children's clothing e commerce company. I've been there for about seven and a half years now. The functions that I oversee are operations of managing our warehouse, our parcel relationships. So like small parcel, like out to customers returns. I also manage the customer experience team and I also oversee Ambalogistics. So getting our product from our overseas or international vendors to our domestic warehouse. So basically managing the product life cycle from pickup at our, at our warehouse, at our vendor partners, all the way out to the customer and then the customer interactions is kind of my oversight. And prior to that I worked at another direct consumer company called Bonobos which did men's clothing online. And I was there for about six years prior to this company. So my background is in clothing and apparel, direct consumer fulfillment.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:25 - 00:08:29)
Okay, that's really helpful, thank you Alex. I'm just, I've got a fan on here and I don't know if you can hear it, but it's.
Alex Kazickas (00:08:29 - 00:08:30)
No, I can't hear it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:31 - 00:08:37)
So maybe I'll leave it then because it's keeping me cool. Although I'm in the UK and it's not sunny, but it's quite warm at the moment.
Alex Kazickas (00:08:37 - 00:08:39)
So, yeah, I can't hear it. So you're good.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:39 - 00:09:03)
All right, good. Thank you. Okay, so what I'd like to start with is sort of exploring the process by which you might evaluate an API solution or vendor. So what, what, what? Thinking again of your current company, what challenges or needs have prompted your company to evaluate shipping API solutions either recently or in the past?
Alex Kazickas (00:09:03 - 00:11:44)
Yeah, you know, basically for our company, when I joined we, I was tasked with basically looking at which carriers would be the best to ship our product to our customers, Obviously looking at price, looking at speed, and looking at consistency of service. And I think those factors. And so I think when we started seven years ago with the way our company was making just children's clothing, like, really, we didn't need a lot of different, different types of carriers to do that. We kind of found one that just worked really well because we were just making like baby and kids, like T shirts and joggers. So, like, the, the packages that we were sending were like the exact same size all the time. So, like, we didn't really need to look at different, different type of carriers to do different things. But as our business GRE started doing more different types of apparel, like categories, we've ventured into adults. We've done some accessories. Like the size of our shipments to our customers has started to range a lot of it. And the partners that we were using to just ship like small packages was not the best partner to be shipping large packages with. So I would say over time we had to look at integrating multiple, multiple different type of carriers to, to get orders to our customers. And that was just depending on who was the best price falling in our, our. Basically our price range of what we, what we want to spend on our packages. And I would say, you know, the way we do it now is we work with a warehouse and I, I manage our personal relationship. So I sign individual contracts with cares and do a lot of research to understand what these packages would cost. And so I built logic with our warehouse to say if it, if it fits in this box, ship it with this carrier. If it doesn't fit in this box or it's bigger, ship with this carrier. So I would say our needs aren't maybe as complex as some other ones where it's really like, you know, different carrots can be different in different zones or different weights. Like ours is pretty straightforward. Like it's below this size of package, below this weight, it's always this carrot. If it's above that, it's a different career. So our logic is pretty simple, but in a case where maybe the company is bigger or we're dealing with five or six carriers and each of them have stronger rates maybe in zone two versus zone four, that's where maybe a solution would be more helpful that's like automates the network. But our logic is pretty straightforward. So we don't have like a complex need for like an API to like look at all these factors and then choose. We're working with only like one to two carriers right now and that the logic is pretty simple. But you know, if I were to look at something more complex, I'd want something to kind of run that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:44 - 00:12:05)
Yeah, okay. So really you can't. You're able to develop that logic in house at the moment for the model that you're using. So. But if you were evaluating a new shipping solution for your company, who would, who would be involved in that process within your company? What kinds of roles would would influence or have a say in the, in the final decision?
Alex Kazickas (00:12:06 - 00:12:21)
It would definitely be the operations teams, the team that I oversee, which is again where a pretty small company under 60, 60 ish employees. So be something that, that we would, I would be overseeing with our team. We would be the decision maker on that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:22 - 00:12:40)
Okay. And then I mean you mentioned some of the criteria already and I understand say your needs are perhaps changing as the company's evolving and you're diversifying your product line. So you've mentioned obviously you know, price. What would be the most important criteria to you for, for choosing a shipping API vendor?
Alex Kazickas (00:12:41 - 00:13:04)
If it would, if like the logic would help us save money with shipping ultimately would be the biggest factor, I would say. And if it would help us also optimize the quickest way to get us get packages to our customers reliably staying in that pricing criteria would be, would be the evaluation for that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:05 - 00:13:11)
Okay, so currently you're not, you don't really have those functions available to you. You're making those decisions your house.
Alex Kazickas (00:13:11 - 00:14:14)
We do, I mean I measure, I measure the transit time by each carrier and in terms of which carriers we're using and how quickly customers are getting packages. So again I, I have an API that we use that's pretty simple and cares that we measure these things. But again I think it depends how Much more complex our parcel needs. If FedEx came to us and said we're going to jack up prices by 20% or something like that, or you know, the general rate increases by cares start to change a lot or know each carriers also implement different rules about dimensional weight and sizing. So these things could change very rapidly. I would say like my need currently would be if like carriers started to do that more regularly and I would be less to be able to say like we fit these boxes, but these now everything is changing. Having a carrier having a shipping API that has access to different carrier rates and can then just say, okay, well if that changed, that shit's really far outside of here, then your next options, this versus me kind of managing those relationships on my own, ultimately that'd be something I'd value it on.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:15 - 00:14:26)
And if you, if you were to at some stage decide to look for, for a new vendor for a shipping API, how, how would you develop that list of possible vendors to, to evaluate?
Alex Kazickas (00:14:27 - 00:14:55)
I would say I've over my time in this, this, this, I guess this industry, I've made a lot of connections in groups with other operators. So my first, my first go to would be asking part of this group, hey, what do you guys use for shipping? You know, shiplogic solutions. What are some of the pros and cons that you experience? So I would see if there's a consensus, one or two or three that people really like and from there ask for introductions.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:56 - 00:14:59)
Sure. Okay, so like maybe personal contacts, recommendations.
Alex Kazickas (00:14:59 - 00:14:59)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:00 - 00:15:11)
Okay. And then I want to move on then to talk a little bit about your current perceptions, if any, of ShipStation APIs. Guy, are you familiar with ship?
Alex Kazickas (00:15:11 - 00:15:13)
Yes, I've heard of it for sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:13 - 00:15:20)
All right, and, and what are your general perceptions? What would you see as their potential strengths or weaknesses based on what you know of them?
Alex Kazickas (00:15:20 - 00:16:32)
I think it just, it solves a problem that's a complex problem that I think a lot of teams like just, you know, don't want to, don't need to build that out themselves. I feel like the idea of a, of a, like a shipping API is like almost like a need at this point, depending on the size you get in the complexity of your business. Again, some businesses just sell one product in one box. So like I don't feel like the need's always there for that. I think it also depends on, you know, it may help simplify if you are running multiple fulfillment centers. So you get an order, you're trying to determine where to send it and what to send it to. I Think you know, depending on how complex your business is and your fulfillment is, could help simplify that. So I think you know, my, my perception of a lot of these things especially substitution is like, you know, solves complex problems if, if it's, you get to the point you realize you need something. So I guess, you know, I have a positive thought, thought about it when I know I've heard it being recommended. But the, the, the solve for it have usually been with businesses that are shipping vastly different size of parcel and things like that and have different contracts that, that are more complex.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:32 - 00:16:41)
Okay, so that means like currently you wouldn't necessarily see your company having a need for that type of solution. Would that be fair to say?
Alex Kazickas (00:16:41 - 00:17:09)
Yes, at this point? I think also, you know, I think some of the balance sometimes is usually when you negotiate volume to get the best race with some carriers, you're putting a lot of your volume in one basket. So having, having like six or seven access usually isn't always the best method in terms of getting the best pricing for everybody. But I think it again I guess is Shipstation just an API or is it also offering rates with the, with the program?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:11 - 00:17:14)
I'm, I know they have various products but to be honest, again I'm not very.
Alex Kazickas (00:17:14 - 00:17:35)
Yeah. So I don't know. I think if it, I think it would be intriguing. Again, I think part of my job as a, as a land leader is every year looking at like what the general rate increases for all these parcel cares, like what is the percent going up, what are the changes and then modeling that, seeing if like we need to pivot or what else is out there. So I think again this could potentially solve some of that problems.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:36 - 00:17:41)
So would you say that you might possibly consider Shipstation API in a future evaluation?
Alex Kazickas (00:17:41 - 00:17:43)
Definitely, for sure. Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:43 - 00:17:59)
Okay. And what would really kind of make you consider it? What kinds of features will particularly stand out as something that perhaps that they're you know, not offering now but, but something that might make it more attractive to, to your company in future.
Alex Kazickas (00:18:00 - 00:19:22)
I don't know if it does this but along with just implementing the best solutions for you to get the best pricing is like robust reporting on it. So I think one just retro reporting, like here's all your packages that you shipped, here's all the costs like which you know, there's very high level KPIs that we'll do. Like what's our average ship cost for standard shipping? Like just knowing that what's our cost by care? Which I think these are all probably basic things that they can do. But I think the other part would be intriguing to me is using that data to help create forecasting models going ahead. So that's like a appealing thing. Something I'm responsible for every year is putting together like forecasting budgets for shipping. And so I look at previous year's data, try to understand a gasser, see when the rates come out, like what does that impact and has impact our, our spend in our business? I look at like zones and like, like it's a distribution Changing is a, it's a core aspect of who we're shipping to changing or is that fluctuating? So I think being able to use that data and help forecast out some scenarios would be very helpful. I don't know if it does that, but that'd be something that's appealing. I'm always looking to avoid unknowns when I'm creating, you know, budgets and forecasting costs and shipping is a huge cost for any E commerce business. So I would say that's, that's a, that'd be an intriguing thing if they do something like that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:22 - 00:19:46)
Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you, Alex. And I know you say like, you know, at this stage you potentially don't have a need for that type of solution. But look, from what you know of shipstation API at the moment, is there anything other than the level of complexity or whatever that would maybe give you cause for concern that you might deter you from, from looking to evaluate them?
Alex Kazickas (00:19:46 - 00:20:51)
I think it's also just weighing the cost on the solution ultimately and what's the value prop of it. So again, I think it depends. Like if my business got to the point where we need to use like seven different carriers in a very complex and strategic way in different zones and states and times, like I think it's probably very well justified, but I think it just depends on what the ongoing costs are of something like that is the main thing. Again, we don't operate our own warehouse, we don't run our own warehouse management system. We work with three PL that does all that. So even in the confines of my decisions, I'm also just tied to like what they're doing in a lot of ways. So again, you know, I don't, I rely on a lot of their technologies around shipping too as well. So like we built their logic in their system which again doesn't mean we can't do it in ours. But I think, I'm sure they work with a lot of brands that don't operate their own fulfillment centers. And so I think it's just about how does this integrate also with our partners?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:52 - 00:21:05)
Right, okay, that's very useful point. So are there, I'm thinking about competitors if you like comparing competitors. So are there any other shipping API vendors that you have considered or evaluated in the past?
Alex Kazickas (00:21:07 - 00:21:26)
Not that I, I, it hasn't been a need for us to implement them at the company I'm working for. So I have done very limited research in the, you know, the, the solutions that are out there. So, so no, I don't know anyone right now that I would consider or an industry that would be, that would, that would consider elsewhere.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:26 - 00:21:34)
That's fine. So other than points you've already made about the sort of again price and perhaps flexibility.
Alex Kazickas (00:21:35 - 00:21:35)
Sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:36 - 00:21:42)
Are there any other factors that would really make a shipping API vendor stand out in, in your view as strengths?
Alex Kazickas (00:21:43 - 00:22:28)
I guess I think it's also in the same way where I look at who's using the products in terms of my counterparts or connections. It also would, it would be persuading to see if like what companies that maybe I'm not have connections that are using. So like are there really big companies that are using it? There companies that are similar to the companies that I'm working with that are using it. So I think like you know, seeing who else is involved in what or what three PL's warehouses are using the solution that's like, that's like because they're. You may not just serve solve the sell to customers like brands, you may serve to fulfillment centers as well. So I think that's really just like, I guess it depends that that would be helpful to understand who else is using and seeing some big names would be helpful as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:29 - 00:22:49)
Okay, that's a really good point. And are there anything that you kind of wish the API vendors might understand better about your company and its needs to actually make them more suitable to what you might be looking for in future. What do they really need to know about how you operate and how they can best serve that?
Alex Kazickas (00:22:50 - 00:23:27)
Yeah, I probably touched about this a little bit, but I think it's just about like creating predictability in our business around this. Like especially in that time when peak surcharges are released every year and no one really knows how much it is or what's going to be or which carriers are using it. So I think along with just the API and I'm sure if they bring rates that are attractive that can get people on it. I think a level of service that would be attractive would be also them having close relationships to these cares and being able to help us forecast these things.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:28 - 00:23:49)
Okay, thank you. I mean it's probably not one that you can answer but maybe from any of your previous company experiences I have a question like can you describe a sales experience with a shipping API vendor that went exceptionally well or poorly and what made it stand out? So I don't know if there's anything you can.
Alex Kazickas (00:23:49 - 00:24:31)
No, I haven't. A lot of the companies again the two companies that I have the most experience that one it was yeah almost 1012 years ago and this shipping parts landscape was a lot different. People were just using one carrier at that time. I already feel old saying that but just one care and you put all your eggs in one basket and absolutely that was it. And again for. For primary because of our very distinct kind of baby kids clothing we sticked with kind of one for the most part but then again when we started doing jackets and things like that, we've started to use another. So again I, I actually have not need to use one that's I have not used had a complex business need that's needed something like that at this point.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:32 - 00:24:35)
That that's. I just thought I'd ask a question anyway in case there was anything.
Alex Kazickas (00:24:35 - 00:24:35)
Sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:37 - 00:24:54)
So almost nearing the end of the interview actually but a section on kind of pricing and value expectations obviously you've mentioned obviously pricing is. Is important to you but how do you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value it provides? Does that make sense?
Alex Kazickas (00:24:54 - 00:26:20)
Yeah, of course. Yeah. I think it depends what's the what's. I'd be curious about what they offer as a value proposition because I feel like using getting you know I think if they can show here's how fast your customers are getting their packages at this pricing and then here's what we could do ultimately for that that would be the most impactful thing. Could we increase our. Can we decrease our click to delivery time to our customers so people are getting it faster and then are we paying most competitive costs across a multi carriers to get us like what's our average ship cost of care so to customer. So I think you know that's like the. The main things that would be the most attractive to me and again how they would show that to me is like we can by using all these different cares and logic we can be very super precise about where who's getting what down to the cents in terms of making sure you could have sent sent this with 50 cents cheaper that's better than this, you know. So I think that overall spend you look at your whole month spend with with our two cares. And they said hey, with seven in this, we could be doing this. And on average you're getting your customers X amount of days. But here you can do it on the seven house that that would be the most impactful thing. And I think again whatever the cost of the service would be just seeing that difference both materialized in the cost format and shipping saving but also quickness to customer. Those would be the two measurements I would see if it's worth it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:21 - 00:26:33)
That's great. And sticking with pricing, I mean do you have views on like an upfront pricing model compared to a more flexible pay as you go type model? Any thoughts on that and how.
Alex Kazickas (00:26:33 - 00:27:22)
Yeah, I feel like pay as you go is more appealing ultimately. And I've seen probably most common, what I've seen is you pay a cost per order. So depending on how many orders you know you're fulfilling, you would do that. And then I've seen also, you know, if you ship X amount of orders per month, like if you ship between, I don't know, 100,000, a million orders per month or a hundred thousand 250, your price order is this. So I would say that like I'm open to like all those types of like pricings. Obviously I would hope that as volume increased we would be seeing some type of benefit at in terms of pricing. So like pricing tiers and stuff like that. So that's how I would think about it ultimately. But I would not want to pay one giant upfront cost ultimately or anything like that. I wouldn't want to prepay for a year or anything like that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:22 - 00:27:34)
Absolutely. Okay, we have a few more minutes. I mean I've gone through most of the main questions, but I want to make sure make the most of this interview. Your answers are fantastic, but you're quite concise. So we've got through them.
Alex Kazickas (00:27:34 - 00:27:35)
Sure. Good, good.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:35 - 00:27:47)
Which is, you know, I'm not complaining. That's, that's really good. But what about like the, you know, the sales and service, what really appeals to you in terms of, you know, what, how that might work, how they would.
Alex Kazickas (00:27:47 - 00:28:33)
Sure, yeah, it's a good question. I think, you know, actually going back to what would be the evaluation of the criteria? Something I would ask when I'm talking to counterparts in the industry, when I'm evaluating a program like this or a solution like this is, you know, how good is your customer service rep or how good is your, is your contact point? Do they, do they help you? Do they like, do you find them As a hindrance to move forward or are they helping you to move forward and scale? And so I think depending on what people say with that is very important. I would say like that. Yeah that's like that's a big thing for me. And I think one other thing also is just like the ease ability to integrate is another one as well. Like how the tech, the integrating with that. Like those are kind of big factors there.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:34 - 00:28:47)
Okay. On that. Can I go back to that customer service issue? So I mean there you're going to ask if we have that they'll all say yes, we have good customer service. I'm sure. So sure. What would you actually what would that look like to you though? You know, in terms of the relationship?
Alex Kazickas (00:28:47 - 00:29:51)
Yeah, I would say like a dedicated onboarding person. So I like want. Would say that I want like a consistent team and reasonable and proven like time frame in terms of implementation. I would say like that also includes like hey we're up and running some type of dedicated support still in the early phases. And then I would say an ongoing contact person that could help us either with like one off tech question issues or greater criteria changes or things that are, that are basically you know, things that maybe bigger project related stuff that comes from customer driven inquiries. And I would say also that that would also look like a meeting quarterly at least and us being informed about what are some of the developments that are coming down the pipeline that we could take advantage of. I also would love companies that ask their biggest clients like hey, what are some features you'd want to see as we're building out a roadmap for the year. People that are kind of two way street and communicating like that is helpful.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:54 - 00:29:59)
Okay, that's great. Thank you. How are we doing? We still have a few minutes. Let's see what else I can ask you.
Alex Kazickas (00:29:59 - 00:29:59)
Sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:01 - 00:30:07)
In the meantime, you know, if there's anything else you can think of that sure like to add to anything we've discussed.
Alex Kazickas (00:30:07 - 00:30:07)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:08 - 00:30:28)
Bearing in mind as I say we're just trying, you know that they want to understand how best to, to serve companies like yours and meet your needs. So. Yeah, I mean I suppose what, what stage might that. You know what would be the, the trigger if you like I mean you mentioned, you know you're, you're growing your.
Alex Kazickas (00:30:28 - 00:30:29)
Yeah.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:29 - 00:30:40)
Specifying do you, do you anticipate kind of reaching that particular point where, where you might need this kind of service and what might that be? What, what what what the trick, what might the triggers be or what might.
Alex Kazickas (00:30:40 - 00:31:43)
Yeah, I would say the two biggest ones would be maybe a fundamental change in our pricing or how we're being billed or priced with our packages currently with our current providers. And I would say something that we're just seeing over the last couple years is just a wide variety of specialized regional carriers. So as in like independent person. It's really hard for me to like sign 2015 different individual contracts and like on track like all these little longer excuse now but like all these different ones that are just like really good like Chicago or something like that or if we want to do like same day shipping in some area and we have a carrier that could do that like I think that like, like if that need came up in terms of like hey we want to increase our speed to our customers, we want to offer better service in certain areas. Like I think taking advantage of like more cares like if suddenly it wasn't two that could really do the best job, it really was like 8 or 9. If we saw the math and looked at all the pricing then like that'd be a no brainer to switch over ultimately.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:44 - 00:31:48)
And do you have a need for international shipping is that you know we're.
Alex Kazickas (00:31:48 - 00:32:22)
Just starting it now. We are starting it now and so we're actually evaluating how we're going to do that in terms of like which carriers we're going to use and speeds we should offer and how we should price it. So I think like that could be a helpful thing as well. Like we, I think again understanding what it could potentially cost is like a, a big unknown for us. Like we have a rate card and it's in sample shipments but we don't know on a large scale and we don't also like to understand like what are the different speeds we can price out and customer can choose to pay them or not. Like could be helpful information but we're still pretty early in that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:23 - 00:32:29)
So could that potentially be quite a driver as well of the kind of solution that you'd be looking for in the future that that would incorporate international.
Alex Kazickas (00:32:30 - 00:33:01)
It could, I think it would just depend how many carers we'd use for international. If we just use like DHL Express and use it for everyone then maybe we wouldn't. But if there really is a big difference between shipping to Australia than there is to the UK and different parts of the UK with different cares and absolutely my intro is so limited and in terms of just like probably just use one carry to start and see what the price is and then. But if you can be more strategic about it then yes you're absolutely right. It could be. It could be a possible avenue to explore it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:01 - 00:33:07)
Okay, well, I will stop there, but I will say, like, is there anything else that you would like to. To add?
Alex Kazickas (00:33:08 - 00:33:09)
No, that's it. I'm good.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:10 - 00:33:24)
That's really helpful. So thank you. That's all the questions I had and really helpful answers, so thank you so much. I understand you'll receive an email from the rewards platform. Tremendous. Which should be within the next 48 hours payment for the interview.
Alex Kazickas (00:33:24 - 00:33:25)
Great.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:25 - 00:33:28)
All right. So thank you so much, Alex. It's been lovely to meet you.
Alex Kazickas (00:33:28 - 00:33:30)
Yeah, lovely to meet you as well and have. Stay cool over there.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:31 - 00:33:34)

3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

1. IF TIME: What factors make a shipping API vendor stand out in your view?

Sales and Support Expectations (4 minutes)
Objective: Evaluate expectations for sales team engagement and support to inform Auctane’s go-to-market strategy.
Client Assumptions: The enterprise sales motion lacks maturity, and support/documentation are key differentiators (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23).
1. What do you wish shipping API vendors understood better about your company and its evaluation process to make it more effective?

1. Win/Loss Drivers: Understand why shipping API solutions are chosen, focusing on customer pain points, decision criteria, and competitive advantages (Chris W, 00:04:18-00:06:47; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25; Cody, 00:14:24-00:15:13; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49).
2. Competitor Strategies: Identify competitors’ pricing, use cases, and go-to-market tactics, particularly EasyPost’s enterprise focus and incentives (Chris O, 00:04:26-00:06:30; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:15:29-00:17:12; Aaron, 00:14:48-00:15:24).
3. Pricing and Packaging: Explore how upfront pricing compares to usage-based models and whether it deters prospects (Chase, 00:12:40-00:13:57; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35; Cody, 00:20:22-00:22:23).
4. ICP Validation: Confirm the emerging enterprise and partner ICPs (10,000–100,000 orders/month), including their specific needs and triggers (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Sales Process Effectiveness: Identify gaps in sales motions (e.g., solution selling, responsiveness) that could appeal to potential customers (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Anne, 00:14:24-00:14:42).
6. Customer Awareness and Perceptions: Understand how prospects discover shipping APIs and their awareness/perceptions of ShipStation API and Auctane (Anne, 00:20:47-00:22:49; Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58).
Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).
2. Commoditized APIs: APIs are assumed to be seen as similar, with decisions hinging on support, documentation, or incentives (Anne, 00:12:57-00:13:26; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:08:27-00:10:16; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25).
3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

Raw Transcript:
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:49 - 00:04:14)
Hi, Franco. Hi, Franco.
Franco Cappitta (00:04:15 - 00:04:24)
Hey, how's it going? You can kick out my note taker. I don't need it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:26 - 00:04:29)
Can't see yet. Are you able to put your video on?
Franco Cappitta (00:04:30 - 00:04:31)
I cannot.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:31 - 00:04:33)
Oh, okay. You're not using video?
Franco Cappitta (00:04:34 - 00:04:34)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:36 - 00:04:44)
All right. Okay. That. That's fine. Would you prefer me to keep my video on or turn mine off too?
Franco Cappitta (00:04:44 - 00:04:45)
Yeah, turn it off.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:45 - 00:04:46)
All right.
Franco Cappitta (00:04:46 - 00:04:47)
That is just awkward.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:48 - 00:05:24)
Okay. Well, it's lovely to meet you anyway. Thank you so much for. For joining the call. Just. Just quick introductions from me. So, I'm Linda. I work with Buried Winds, which is a third party research firm working currently with ShipStation API to help improve how they serve prospects and customers. So we're conducting this interview, really, to help ShipStation API learn more about your shipping API needs. So with. I understand your recording, I guess that's okay. I've never had that. That situation, but.
Franco Cappitta (00:05:26 - 00:05:28)
If you want, you can kick it out. It just comes automatically. I don't know.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:28 - 00:05:42)
Okay. I mean, I. I'm not sure, to be honest. I think it would be better. Just. I'm not. How do I do that? I can put in waiting room. Maybe that works.
Franco Cappitta (00:05:42 - 00:05:43)
There you go.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:44 - 00:05:57)
All right. I think that's okay. Yeah. Well, I was going to say, though, we do record the conversation with your permission, which we share the recording with shipstation API, along with a transcript of the interview. So is that okay with you, Franco?
Franco Cappitta (00:05:57 - 00:05:58)
Yep, that's fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:58 - 00:06:04)
Fantastic. Thank you so much. So do you have any questions for me before we get started on the interview? Questions?
Franco Cappitta (00:06:05 - 00:06:05)
Nope.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:06 - 00:06:20)
All right, that's fine. So we have quite a lot to get through with within half an hour, so I'll plunge into them. But before. Before I do, if you could just very briefly introduce yourself and your role and the company that you're working for at the moment, just for some background information.
Franco Cappitta (00:06:21 - 00:06:33)
Yeah. I'm the CTO at Tire Agent, an E commerce company where we mainly ship tires and wheels. And I've been here for eight years, since the beginning.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:34 - 00:06:51)
Okay. All right. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. So first question I have is what. What challenges or needs have prompted your company to evaluate shipping API solutions either recently or in the past?
Franco Cappitta (00:06:53 - 00:07:09)
Well, we ship, you know, over a thousand tires per day, so a lot of them require shipping labels, so that's pretty much it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:09 - 00:07:30)
Okay, so it's the nature of your business and the volume of shipping that you have. Yeah. And if you're evaluating a shipping API solution in your company, can you talk to me a bit about how that process works and who would be involved. Like which, which roles would be involved in influencing or making the final decision on, on the solution?
Franco Cappitta (00:07:31 - 00:07:57)
I would be because I have the most thorough knowledge about the implementation and how it would be used within the company. And then people on my team would then further, further down the, the, the process, once a decision has been made, would do implementation that I would oversee.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:59 - 00:08:16)
Okay, so does that mean that you would kind of make that decision pretty much by yourself or what would you have put into the decision unilaterally? Okay, yep. All right, that's, that's helpful. So, and then the team would be involved more in on the implemented implementation side.
Franco Cappitta (00:08:17 - 00:08:17)
Yep.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:18 - 00:08:24)
Yeah. And how would you develop a list of vendors to evaluate for shipping API solutions?
Franco Cappitta (00:08:25 - 00:08:44)
There's really only three or four that I would even consider which are the main players in the space. So I really just kind of from time to time continually just go check and see if there are any major changes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:46 - 00:08:50)
So can I ask who, who those four main players would be in your view?
Franco Cappitta (00:08:51 - 00:08:59)
Sure. Like easy post Shippo Station. That's really it?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:59 - 00:09:06)
I guess so. Ship Station. So three, three that you primarily.
Franco Cappitta (00:09:06 - 00:09:09)
Yeah, I've looked at them in the past.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:10 - 00:09:16)
Okay, so can I ask then, is there one in particular that you're using at the moment?
Franco Cappitta (00:09:18 - 00:09:22)
Yeah, I'm actually using something else called Rocketship.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:22 - 00:09:36)
Okay. All right. And when, so when you are evaluating a potential API shipping API vendor, what would be the most important criteria for the selection?
Franco Cappitta (00:09:39 - 00:09:53)
Well, I mean in Ship Station's case, I've never even considered it because there is one important thing that's a requirement for me that they don't have, which is the ability to support multi piece shipments.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:54 - 00:09:55)
Okay.
Franco Cappitta (00:09:58 - 00:10:05)
Maybe they've added it more recently, but for years it was just not something that was supported.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:08 - 00:10:15)
Okay, and the other solutions that you've mentioned, the other vendors, do they offer that, that facility?
Franco Cappitta (00:10:19 - 00:10:56)
To be honest, I think it's, it's not something that is as widely used and so usually finding documentation on it and, and how to utilize them is very difficult. As well as usually getting in touch with somebody who can answer questions about the implementation is also very difficult. So they may or may not like vaguely touch upon it, but it's usually not thorough enough.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:59 - 00:11:09)
So do you mean it's difficult to access support to provide information as to whether they would offer multi piece shipments or do you mean. Yeah.
Franco Cappitta (00:11:09 - 00:11:13)
Or the documentation is, you know, is very, very vague.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:14 - 00:11:22)
Okay. Yeah, yeah. And is that something with Rocket Ship that you found has, has worked better for you?
Franco Cappitta (00:11:22 - 00:11:23)
Extremely well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:23 - 00:11:42)
Okay. Okay. Maybe I'LL come back to that. But just thinking still about the process of evaluating vendors, is there anything else that you take into account? I mean, I'm guessing price and aspects like that. But you know, generally what are the factors that you'd be thinking about when considering which solution to adopt?
Franco Cappitta (00:11:45 - 00:12:24)
Yeah, to be honest, that has been my main problem right now because there's always been so little support for it. And just to give an example of how important it is, like, you know, for my business, I would typically ship to a customer like a set of four tires and each tire would get its own label. And so it's very important that we can create like the master label and all the sub labels that tie into the same tracking number. So that way when a customer does tracking, it's very easy for them to see everything in the same page with like let's say for example, FedEx.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:25 - 00:12:32)
So it's kind of like a multi layer process, I suppose for you, isn't it, with the overall order and then the suborders or the sub.
Franco Cappitta (00:12:34 - 00:12:41)
And then it also makes it easier for our logistics team to deal with any issues as well because everything is under one master tracking number.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:43 - 00:12:49)
So is that still a continuing struggle? You have to really get, get the kind of service that you'd like to have in that area.
Franco Cappitta (00:12:50 - 00:12:51)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:53 - 00:13:33)
Yeah, it's working for you now. Yeah. Fine. So I'll move on to ask a few more questions specifically about ShipStation API and your, your perceptions of that solution. So I mean, I had a question. Are you familiar with ShipStation API? I think you've, you've answered that already. You've said it is a company that, that you've considered. So, so what are your, your perceptions? I mean, you've said obviously that the, the, the issue of the multi piece shipments, I understand, is something that, not aware that they would be able to offer more generally as a shipping API. What would you see as the primary strengths or weaknesses of ShipStation API based on your understanding?
Franco Cappitta (00:13:34 - 00:14:25)
I mean, in general, I know that they're a leader in the space. I imagine the uptime is very high. You know, on the client side. The, you know, I go in every once in a while and I still have a login and the UI is very usable. You know, documentation looks good for, for what's available. So I really don't have anything negative to say outside of like just me really needing one key feature. And it does look like, you know, I'm checking right now more recently. It does look like it's a bit updated and may Support it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:27 - 00:14:33)
So does that mean that you would consider Shipstation API if you were considering changing vendors in future?
Franco Cappitta (00:14:36 - 00:14:47)
Probably not at this point, just because, you know, the only thing I'd really get out of it is being exactly where I am now with a different provider.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:50 - 00:15:01)
So what could ShipStation API, or any other vendor for that matter offer? Do you feel that could potentially make you change providers?
Franco Cappitta (00:15:02 - 00:15:06)
Oh, well, we do a lot of Last Mile delivery.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:07 - 00:15:07)
Mm.
Franco Cappitta (00:15:08 - 00:15:09)
Are you familiar with that?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:09 - 00:15:12)
Not really. No. Can you explain that to me?
Franco Cappitta (00:15:12 - 00:15:30)
Yeah. So Last Mile delivery is. Is more of a. Think of it as like a courier service. Right. So think of like uber eats and DoorDash, but for. For packages.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:30 - 00:15:31)
Okay.
Franco Cappitta (00:15:31 - 00:16:24)
So a lot of right now it's. It's kind of like the wild west, I'd say, where there's a lot of companies that offer these solutions and they all have custom tracking. And so it would be nice if there was one API that handled all of that and they're kind of standardized the different statuses as well as had all of these companies on board already. So that way it would make integration for me a whole lot easier in terms of tracking and customer notification.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:25 - 00:16:37)
So I'm just trying to understand in my head how that works in the case of tire delivery, the last. Last mile deliveries. So people like, order on. On the app. Is. Is that how it works?
Franco Cappitta (00:16:38 - 00:17:11)
Well, so, like, you go to a website and you decide, you know, you put in your vehicle information, and then you say, I have this. This car and. And we show you the. The tires that'll fit. Right. And. And you order them. And potentially, like, if they're clo. If the warehouse is close enough to the customer, we use a service where like, you know, they might have somebody with a sprinter van or a pickup truck, and they will pay them, you know, X dollars to go pick it up and drop it off at the customer, as opposed to us using like a traditional FedEx or UPS.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:12 - 00:17:12)
I see.
Franco Cappitta (00:17:12 - 00:17:15)
Because it's already like a close enough distance.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:15 - 00:17:24)
Right, Got it. Yeah. Okay, that's really interesting. So that's something. Obviously, if that was built in, that that could be. Could potentially be quite attractive to you.
Franco Cappitta (00:17:25 - 00:18:17)
Yeah. Because we're. We're adding more and more of these, and every time we have to do it, it's a custom integration where we have to do two pieces, which is the ordering process and then the tracking. Right. And so if, at least right off the bat, I could cut off the tracking, it would. Or I could standardize the tracking. It would make my life a lot easier. Because everything would be standardized to just like the one API. That's the first thing. And the second thing would be like it would make onboarding some of these partners, these newer partners more attractive because be less work on our side because we would already have the one API integration for other partners and so just adding another one would be ready to relatively easier.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:18 - 00:18:20)
Sure, that, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Okay.
Franco Cappitta (00:18:21 - 00:18:24)
And that's where like the industry is moving a lot right now.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:26 - 00:18:27)
That's helpful to know.
Franco Cappitta (00:18:29 - 00:18:33)
In general E commerce like taking advantage of these, these last mile services.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:33 - 00:19:22)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an interesting trend. So anything else just to mention in terms of perceptions of ShipStation API before I move on? No. Okay, so the next section really kind of still in the area of valuation, but thinking more about competitors and competitor comparisons which we have touched on. So you've mentioned, I had a question like which shipping API vendors have you evaluated or are you aware of which? I think you pretty much answered, but I just want to check that we've covered that. So looking back, I mean you mentioned, I think easypost and Shipo as well as Ship Station. Another one is Pro Ship. Have you heard of Pro Ship?
Franco Cappitta (00:19:23 - 00:19:29)
No, we also at one point we were looking at a aftership as well. And again this is, this is quite a while back.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:33 - 00:19:52)
So in terms of you mentioned you're working obviously with Rocket Ship at the moment. Can you talk a little bit more about what you do like about Rocketship and what were the key strengths of them, like when you went through evaluating particular vendors at that time, why you selected Rocketship particularly?
Franco Cappitta (00:19:53 - 00:20:56)
Yeah, they, I mean they really had the feature that I needed that was easy to use. They're very accessible and they actually can add features like by request. And so early on there were some things I needed and they added it within a couple of days. The other thing is it's very, it's very scalable for low cost. So basically what it does is it provides, it utilizes my existing like FedEx and UPS API keys and I pay a very small fee per month, I want to say 49 or something. And I run it on my own server and I just generate all the labels I need. So it's really just a wrapper to make the FedEx and UPS APIs more developer friendly because their standard documentation is like a thousand pages. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:57 - 00:21:20)
So it really fits your needs at the moment. Yep, yep. What other factors, if any, would make a shipping API vendor stand out to you, do you think? Is there anything else that we haven't mentioned? Anything maybe when you were looking at other vendors and there was something that you actually really liked about that, even though you didn't select them ultimately. Any other factors that stood out?
Franco Cappitta (00:21:21 - 00:21:47)
Maybe some. You know, the thing is we don't actually have anybody who's like, dedicated at being at the forefront of like FedEx and UPS features. So maybe some sort of like, I don't know, quarterly meeting to discuss, you know, actual features we could take advantage of with the major carriers that we may not be even like aware of to utilize.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:49 - 00:22:13)
Okay, that, that's a great idea. And that kind of segues quite well into my next set of questions, which is more around sales and support expectations. So I think it's very quite relevant what you've just said. But what do you wish that shipping API vendors understood better about your company and its needs to make that relationship work more effectively?
Franco Cappitta (00:22:18 - 00:23:30)
I guess how we intend to use the product and maybe, you know, some problem solving on, on, you know, a lot of it is very like independent. You know, a lot of them are, you know, just sign up and start using it and access the docs and kind of figure it out yourself. And while like I can figure out how to use the API, I'm not an expert in what say, shipping carriers. Right. So you know, we kind of just make through, make do and kind of figure out, you know, what's going to work for us and how to utilize them. But you know, especially earlier on that would, right now where I, you know, that's not as big of a deal. But earlier on it would have been very helpful to have a crash course and like actually understanding like what we should or shouldn't do or what like a best practice might be for, you know, shipping or what are some ways that we can solve some early pain points with scaling, etc.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:32 - 00:23:45)
So that sounds like kind of, yeah, understanding of your needs and how they could address them. Maybe something about just the onboarding process. From what I'm picking up and a little bit more hand holding at the, at the outset, would that be fair to.
Franco Cappitta (00:23:46 - 00:24:55)
Yeah, I think so. You know, I, I have to assume, you know, coming from day one of the startup, I think, and being in a startup accelerator where, you know, there were other companies that were also kind of going through similar processes is that like, you know, most people know that they need to ship something and then immediately find like a quick solution to get it done and do kind of focus on, on pricing, but like that ends up being like the extent of it and then you kind of learn through the pain of like, oh well, like what's a better way that I can like let my customer know know like the tracking status. Right. And, or like you kind of like figure this out like as each situation is coming up. But I think there's probably some sort of like boilerplate process that could help any company that's going to start shipping, like, you know, look at what to implement right away, what are some things to take advantage of as you start to scale, etc.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:56 - 00:25:03)
Sure, yeah. I mean it's, I suppose a lot of time there's reinventing the wheel and companies are going through the same thing, aren't they? The same?
Franco Cappitta (00:25:04 - 00:25:05)
Exactly, exactly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:05 - 00:25:24)
Right, yeah, sure. So can you think about a sales experience with a shipping API vendor that either went exceptionally well or very, very badly? Like this could be going back, you know, a few years or whenever or more recently. So is there anything that really stands out that you can talk about?
Franco Cappitta (00:25:26 - 00:26:15)
No, not really. I mean to be honest, I, I, at the beginning, you know, we, we were looking for a solution, trying to figure out how we could automate label creation and, and we needed this one feature, which is the multi piece. We found the software that does it and we kind of just have stuck with it through the years because I did, you know, reevaluate a few years ago and I still found like a complete lack of support across the board from, you know, the major players. And so I just haven't made any changes and you know, at this point don't necessarily see a need to.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:16 - 00:26:25)
It does sound like quite a big gap, doesn't it? And I'm sure there's other situations, not just tires, there must be many other situations like that where there's a need for that kind of service.
Franco Cappitta (00:26:26 - 00:27:30)
I mean we've kind of just, we've built our business around that being a requirement and so maybe other companies aren't as sensitive to it. But the thing is, specifically when you get tires because of their size, they have to typically be sent separately and the expectation is that you will get all four together. And so by having that multi piece shipment, a lot of times FedEx will do like two today and two tomorrow because it doesn't fit on the truck, or three today and one tomorrow because it doesn't fit on the truck and it leads a lot of calls from the customer saying I got three instead of four, where having that multi piece tracking shows that three arrive and that one is coming tomorrow. And so it reduces the amount of calls that our team needs to address just for that one thing lot. And so it's. It for us it's just like a must have and I imagine for a lot of other, other businesses it's, it's not as specific.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:31 - 00:28:01)
Yeah, yeah, I get that. But I'm sure it's not a unique need. Yeah, that's very interesting point. Okay, Franco. Well, we're nearing the end of the interview. The, the really the last section I have is more around pricing and, and value expectations which, which haven't spoken very much about pricing. When you mentioned that you've. It sounds like you've got a really favorable pricing arrangement at the moment. But the question I have is how do you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value it provides?
Franco Cappitta (00:28:04 - 00:28:59)
I mean to be fair, most of the like pricing is pretty, I want to say pretty close across the board. So something like you know, a, a penny per tracking number or under unsightly under that as you like really start to scale up to thousands and thousands per month. That seems pretty fair to me based on like the amount of API calls you'd probably make. Multiple API calls per per tracking number. Right. As it's in route and stuff like that. So you know, it's like I'm looking right now at, at the ship station pricing and it seems, you know, very in line with expectations.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:00 - 00:29:08)
So does that mean then that price is not a major differentiator for you when you're, when you're comparing vendors? Because they tend to be quite similar.
Franco Cappitta (00:29:09 - 00:29:31)
Yeah, for me like our scale now it's, it's price is not a big deal actually at most scales it's not really that big of a deal. I feel like it's a relatively small portion of, of like your, your cogs almost negligible.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:32 - 00:29:42)
Do you have a view though on pros and cons of different pricing model is like like say an upfront versus a pay as you go pricing structure or, or model?
Franco Cappitta (00:29:43 - 00:31:47)
I I don't know. Depends on the, the, the person. I mean I do like, I think I like a, a flat fee just because you know, you have an. There's no surprise expectations. Right. But like you know, if you, if you're scaling quickly and your volume surges like it's probably a bit unfair to the provider that you know, the expectation was for let's say half the volume and then you know, you do double and then like their costs for maintaining infrastructure and whatever are you know, higher than expected. I don't know again like I could really, it really doesn't matter to me to be honest, which I'M sure is surprising. But like, again, we're at the stage where we're doing, you know, I want to say maybe 80 to 100,000 tracking numbers per month, let's say. And so I see over here, like for 20,800, you know, like standard and over 20,000, like, it probably gets even better in terms of like the per tracking number price. So it's a small cost, a small, very small portion of everything we do. And so whether or not it's 0.6 cents or 0.7 cents or 0.8 cents, at the end of the day, that comes out to a difference of X hundred dollars per month, which at this scale is, you know, to me, if one service versus another is $200 less per month, I couldn't care less about the $200. I care way more about the reliability, you know, whether it's going to meet our needs and things like that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:48 - 00:32:09)
Sure, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so it's having the right offering, the right type of facility. Obviously the multi piece, I think is very important for you. And, and, and the, from what you've said, the sort of, the customer service, the, the onboarding, the understanding your business, would you agree that, that, that, that then, then would be, they would be far more important.
Franco Cappitta (00:32:09 - 00:32:20)
That was, that was, that was more important earlier on. I mean, you know, if, if we're talking about like when we were getting started, like, that would have helped a lot more. Now it's, it's not really that big of a deal.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:21 - 00:32:35)
Yeah, I understand. Okay, well, we're, we're almost up to the half an hour and I'm sure you're very busy, so I don't want to. Than is necessary, but just to say, is there anything else that you'd like to mention or add before we finish?
Franco Cappitta (00:32:36 - 00:32:36)
No.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:37 - 00:32:55)
Okay. Well, it's been really interesting speaking with you, Franco, but very, very useful interview. Thank you so much. So, just to mention, I understand you'll receive an email from the rewards platform called Tremendous with your payment for the interview. It should be within the next 48 hours. Okay.
Franco Cappitta (00:32:55 - 00:32:56)
We work with them too.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:57 - 00:32:59)
Okay. It's a small world.
Franco Cappitta (00:32:59 - 00:33:02)
Well, no, they're, they're very, you know, they're the industry leader.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:03 - 00:33:07)

Raw Transcript

Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:38 - 00:04:38)
Hello, Jared.
Jerrod Black (00:04:38 - 00:04:43)
Hello. Hello, it's Gerard. Hi, how you doing?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:43 - 00:04:45)
I'm good, yeah. Are you able to use your video?
Jerrod Black (00:04:46 - 00:04:48)
Yes, Give me one second here.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:48 - 00:04:52)
Fabulous. Hi. Hello. Lovely to meet you as well.
Jerrod Black (00:04:52 - 00:04:53)
How are you?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:53 - 00:04:54)
I'm good, thank you. And you?
Jerrod Black (00:04:54 - 00:04:56)
I am great. I'm great. Thank you so much.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:57 - 00:05:48)
Thank you. That's great. So I have a lot to get through in just a short time, so I'm really, really grateful to you for giving up your time. I'm going to plunge straight, straight into it. First of all, just a few preliminaries that I need to go over. So basically I'm Linda and I'm working with Buried Winds, which is a third party research firm which is currently working with Shipstation API to improve how they serve their prospects and customers. So the purpose of this interview is really just to help Shipstation's API learn more about your shipping API needs. And with your permission, we are recording the conversation. Okay, fantastic. So do you have any questions before I launch into my questions for you?
Jerrod Black (00:05:49 - 00:05:50)
No, go ahead, let's shoot it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:05:50 - 00:06:13)
Fantastic. Thank you. So basically the first set of questions, it's kind of about the process by which you evaluate IPA vendors and solutions. So can I ask you first of all? Oh, actually before I do that, I've missed an important question. I'd just really like you to give me a very brief introduction. Introduction to yourself and, and your company and role. Just anything you'd like to say about that?
Jerrod Black (00:06:13 - 00:07:09)
Of course, yeah. My name is Gerard Black, everybody calls me jb. I work for a company called Titan Worldwide which I'm a partner in. We are a full time heavy haul super load freight brokerage. We do all FTL and ltl. As far as the API solutions, I actually worked for Oracle before doing my own thing here. So definitely familiar with Oracle and Netsuite here we use a API called Turvo which is kind of like a more so LTL, FTL type of platform and then also I cover the entire country, usa, Canada as well and I work with various customers all over from FedEx to UPS, all the way to NASA, the US military and just kind of all over. So yeah. Any questions? Hopefully I can help you out.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:10 - 00:07:31)
Fantastic, that's really helpful background. Thank you Gerard. And it sounds like you're a busy man. Okay, so can I ask first of all then, are there any particular challenges or needs that have led your company to evaluate shipping API solutions like either recently or in the past?
Jerrod Black (00:07:31 - 00:08:44)
Yeah, I would say the biggest thing this verse or API solutions for a lot of Platforms, just the manual process and kind of streamlining that process for us, it has been quite bit of a help. Turbo for instance, they don't necessarily have a, the, it's not streamlined as automatic where we have to just manually input a lot of the information. So sometimes, obviously from that sometimes there's hiccups or errors or sometimes the updated systems aren't as well. So I would say that. And then also at times we have reorder points in certain situations where we need those to be as sharp and as quick and as accurate as possible and just through a large quantity of orders coming in. Sometimes not all the time, but sometimes those reorder points are sometimes off. So. So again I think that kind of goes back into the more manual process versus that automatic process. Everything is automated. So yeah, those are the biggest two that I would say that I kind of deal with are like sticklers from time to time. Not all the time, of course, but that's the top two I would say.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:08:45 - 00:09:02)
Okay, so really having that automation would be a priority for you. Yeah, so. And in terms of the process, the evaluation process, can you talk to me a little bit about how, how that happens in your company? Who's involved, what kinds of roles are involved in influencing or making the decision.
Jerrod Black (00:09:03 - 00:09:40)
For, for, for this type of solution systems that we use? Yeah, I think it's more of a team effort. I like I said I'm partnered with Titan Worldwide now and it's a smaller company. When I say smaller, I mean like just the amount of employees. We have about in total, nine or 10 employees. So it's kind of a group decision, if you will. But I myself and then my partner Ryan, who is pretty much like our full on operations guy as well, he, we look for, like I said, things to be, I'm sorry, was it was the question. What was the question? One more time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:40 - 00:09:47)
Really? You know, who, who in your company would have a role in influence final decision or the. Yeah, yep.
Jerrod Black (00:09:47 - 00:09:51)
Guy named Ryan. Who is my guy named Ryan? His name is Ryan is my partner.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:51 - 00:10:00)
Okay. All right, so and then what, what are the most important criteria do you think when you're choosing a shipping API vendor.
Jerrod Black (00:10:03 - 00:11:50)
Just making life easier a little bit. I think we have a, just such a vast difference of customers that you know, you could come from FedEx or it could be a very, just a smaller local family company all the way to a huge, you know, aerospace company or something like that. So being able to cater to whatever specific types of companies that we deal with in whatever manner they will be in would be nice in a solution. I know customization sometimes within the platforms are, you know, it's hit or miss, but if you were able to just customize it once again to this specific customer, meaning like if they have a certain reorder point, if they have certain hours operations or you know, certain times where I need to be notified, maybe a SKU is overextended or empty or needing to just be updated in that way. I think that that would be one and just make it a very streamlined. I know I keep saying the manual process, but that's just the biggest one is, you know, a lot of the things, whether they lead to error or just kind of take a very, very long time. You know, time is key obviously because you want to get these orders in and out and just make sure that these pickups and deliveries are all on point. So keeping that in order. And also just lastly, the customer, you know, CRM type of aspect, being able to speak and have updated customer profiles, being able to notice or get a notification if an email or number is off or a bounce back or somebody got fired or something like that. Just making it very streamlined in that way as well.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:50 - 00:12:07)
Okay, and then I mean you mentioned, I think you're working with Turbo at the moment. So when you, when you entered into that relationship, I mean did you evaluate different solutions or different vendors at that time? And if so, how did you identify who to include in that evaluation?
Jerrod Black (00:12:10 - 00:13:35)
Well, when we started off, I think at that time we've actually, you know, quite, thankfully we've grown quite a bit. But at that time we were just looking for an easy enough solution that we can all work and it could be simple but also be able to handle the type of orders that we have. To be honest, Turbo is a more of a LTL type of platform like drive in sprinter vans, so kind of smaller trailers versus the ones we use. But they have been great to us over the years. So we've stuck with them for now just because they have kind of catered to us in a way. So when we were choosing them, it was them. We looked at Oracle for a little while just because I came from there. So I was super familiar with that platform. And then also we looked at a company called Six Sense, which I don't know if you ever heard of them before, but they are a company based in San Francisco and a lot of their things they find leads through keywords essentially. So you know, if I need a just say a flatbed trailer, I can just type in a flatbed and geotag the website and then I would get all the people who need who came to my website in search of a flatbed trailer. So those were the top three I would say for now that we were looking at. And then Turbo just seemed to be the best option for us at that time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:36 - 00:13:44)
Okay, so was that largely then the companies you were already aware of rather than doing any new research to, to identify potential vendors?
Jerrod Black (00:13:44 - 00:14:14)
Correct. I think Sixtus was the newest one that we had heard of. So it kind of, we got a, a, a tour, you know, a kind of a mock day in the life of how we would be using the system and they were very nice about it. But yeah, that was the newest one. And then the other two obviously we were just super familiar with, we had heard of through a friend or a reference. I have a few friends that own a few businesses and so yeah, we just contacted them and then they set some stuff up for us. For example.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:14 - 00:14:25)
Okay, so I'd like to then to move on to your perceptions or knowledge if you have any of ShipStation API. So are you familiar with ShipStation API?
Jerrod Black (00:14:25 - 00:14:38)
You know, I kind of checked it out. So you guys, is shipstation more so a CRM or is it a full, full platform, what all entails?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:40 - 00:14:48)
I'm a researcher and an interviewer, so I actually don't have a detailed knowledge. Yeah, yeah, just your perceptions. What do you think they are?
Jerrod Black (00:14:49 - 00:15:41)
I think what it is, is, it seems like it is making once again streamlining the service but also keeping just everything cost wise, being cost efficient and also just being able to have your information stored inside in one place. I think we call it one source of truth or something like, I don't forget they always making fun of me but, but yeah, one source of truth for everything. And being able to keep and also being able to integrate all of this system into your other systems as well. So that's what I took from it first initially. I actually checked it out a few days ago and I had to pull it up this morning, but that's what I got from it. And helping out with just those shipments and keeping everything in order.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:45 - 00:16:00)
That'S really helpful. So from the research you've done and your initial perceptions, I mean do you see then particular strengths or weaknesses in relation to what your company would need in terms of that kind of solution?
Jerrod Black (00:16:02 - 00:17:14)
Yeah, I mean as far as the, the carrier rates for sure. I know they mentioned that they can save money on carrier rates, which is always nice for us. Right. So that was number one. And then once again I've said this 80 times, probably say it 80 more times, but they seem to be seamless. You know, a lot of the things are either connected or they flow well together. And it's not, it doesn't seem at least like a manual process, which is very nice. And then what was the last thing actually? Oh yeah, it was, it was, it was outside of the country too. Like I could work in other countries outside of the usa, Canada. There are times where, you know, I can be getting stuff from anywhere around the world. And you know, Purvo, as we speak about this doesn't go, it goes a lot of places but doesn't go everywhere, you know, so being able to reach those countries that I couldn't necessarily reach or had to make another profile or something like that, just have integrated in the system is extremely helpful.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:15 - 00:17:19)
Okay, so do you feel that you would consider Shipstation API in a future evaluation?
Jerrod Black (00:17:21 - 00:18:02)
Yeah, I would definitely say so. I'm always open to it and I'm always open to seeing how they could possibly help us and if they could help us, then we're always open to that conversation. We all come from, I say we, everybody that's on my team, we come from tech backgrounds. So having, having user friendly platforms that can help us out in any sort of little way and take out the manual process, cut time and cost. We're always open for it. I can, I'll always at least have a conversation and see it for sure.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:02 - 00:18:15)
And there was anything in terms of what you've seen that you feel you'd sort of want reassurance about any particular concerns or like I said, like possible weaknesses in relation to your knees. Did anything concern you at all?
Jerrod Black (00:18:18 - 00:18:59)
Not necessarily from what I've seen. I would love to like, I think it would be extremely helpful if it was a, a not presentation with sample mock day or sort of like a run through of the actual platform so I can see tools and ins and outs of it because it's different when I can go to the website all day and look up all this. But you know, to have it really resonate, I think it would be nice to have like a, you know, example of it or kind of like a, I'm blanking out on the word I'm looking for right now, but a just presentation of what it would actually look like and all the tools that can use and everything like that.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:59 - 00:19:31)
Okay, so I have some questions kind of the. In the section entitled competitor comparison which we've spoke about, I think a little bit already because I have a question like which shipping API vendors have you evaluated or are you aware of? So that's another part. Are there any others I guess that you're aware of? Because I'm thinking, I mean, let's say it's not my industry, but from what you mentioned, Turbo, is that that would be a little different as a type of solution than Shipstation, Is that correct?
Jerrod Black (00:19:32 - 00:20:03)
Definitely. Type. Different types. Let me give you a little one second here because let me see if we have any on our list that we different softwares. The only run, the only two that I say that I'm aware of that we. Somebody reached out but it just didn't happen, was Ship Hawk. I don't know if you ever heard of them.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:05 - 00:20:07)
Say again, sorry, Ship Hawk.
Jerrod Black (00:20:07 - 00:20:08)
So Ship.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:09 - 00:20:11)
Okay, I'm not, I'm not aware. No.
Jerrod Black (00:20:12 - 00:20:17)
Another one called Ship O. So S H I P P O.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:17 - 00:20:20)
Okay, yeah, I have heard of Shippo. Yeah.
Jerrod Black (00:20:21 - 00:20:39)
And that was the only two that are on. We keep like a list of just different softwares and stuff like that that are potential. Those are the only two that I have really like, you know, seen or have heard of outside of this one that I even, you know, kind of entertained or have come up in conversations.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:39 - 00:20:50)
When I say I have a couple of other names I'd be interested to know if you've heard of easypost and Pro Ship. So you. Would you be familiar with those?
Jerrod Black (00:20:50 - 00:20:53)
Pro Ship, maybe Easy Post, I have not heard of.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:53 - 00:21:06)
Okay, so thinking of the. You've mentioned Ship Port, Shippo and Pro Ship. What do you know about them? Can you tell me anything about your, your perceptions of. Of those companies?
Jerrod Black (00:21:08 - 00:24:15)
I think that what the Ship Hawk was, I think we were noticed or we noticed them because of the streamline process, the automated process that they speak about. And then also they were, I think they were carrier friendly, which was a big thing. So when we use drivers, you know, we have our direct drivers, but also we use different drivers every day as well, you know, because we subcontract these drivers that come in. So of course with that there are a lot of things that you just want to have on the order and just kind of associated with the order from carriers just because there's so many. And you know, sometimes carriers are very nice people and sometimes carriers are very mean people. So you just have to figure that out. So yeah, that was the biggest thing that set up that I noticed with Ship Hawk at least is that they had a lot of intuitive tools to keep track of like carriers and also be able to log into specific information just about carriers that you would need which once again in other platforms it even did have anything like that at all or it did like one little section and you had to manually, you know, type in all this stuff. So yeah, that was the biggest thing with Ship Hawk and then for the other one which was Pro Ship. What was Pro Ship was a while ago. I just remember them being just a. Who were you working with? It was maybe it was maybe a shirt company that we were working that use their system that were. That we were working with closely. And so from working with them they were not a mass producer but they had a good number of orders and they seem to be pretty dependent on the Pro Ship system. So from that I, you know, can't say I'm a a native user but I saw their software a lot and it seemed to have a lot of just for that specific industry a lot of good just information and data, just about what was actually going on on the day to day. The one thing I do remember is that their KPIs for everyday login were very, very sharp and up to date and just kept us very, very informed as to where they were, where they were every day. If there were any sort of task assigned to us. And also if they had, if they requested an order or anything like that, it was an instant notification. It wasn't anything. You know, sometimes it might send an email and then a notification come later. That seemed to be super streamlined and automated which almost like instantly which I thought was very nice. But that is the island. All I can say about Pro Shift that's.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:15 - 00:24:31)
That's okay. So it seems like some of the aspects of this type of solution that are important to you like as much automation as possible, intuitive systems, you know, things just happening, not having to have too much manual input. Does anything else stand out as, as being important?
Jerrod Black (00:24:35 - 00:25:56)
And also I think I would add to that list is just good customer relationship management. So the CRM is a big important piece to that because we do have so many clients that come in either requesting for quotes or just existing customers that I have to keep track of that, you know. And you know some of the orders are large so you know any sort of default or mistake in that can be very, very costly. So just having a CRM that keeps track and is most up to date and it's just easy to maneuver for just users who might not be as tech friendly as us, you know. So simplicity, yeah, simplicity is nice. Even though I know sometimes platforms, you know, are complex. Simplicity is key for me, you know, if, because I understand it but you know, my dispatch guy who didn't work at Oracle for a long time might not understand all that, you know, so if we could break it down or have something at least where he can learn, because every, anybody can learn anything, right? So if as long as we can have a good example for him to learn, then that's all I really care about. So customer relationship management as well, CRM.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:57 - 00:26:15)
And thinking then about kind of sales and support expectations. What do you wish that shipping API vendors understood better about your company and its, its needs, its evaluation process to, to. To make that process more effective? I suppose for you.
Jerrod Black (00:26:17 - 00:28:07)
The great question. I think that the biggest thing, especially in any sort of logistics industry is that it almost never goes right the first time. So just being able to adjust and pivot almost on the fly or change information up in a whim is kind of vital in that because you know, you do have orders. If it goes great, then great. But out of 10 orders, maybe four or five of them are going to go great and then the other five are going to be not nightmares. But you're gonna have to adjust something. You know, it what it is either whether it's the location, the order, the amount, who it's going to, the labels, or whatever that is, you know. So being able to adjust on the fly is something. And update just information on a fly is just very, very big. For example, you know, we have an order and maybe, you know, a label or a bill of lading or something like that just needs a correction or update or maybe even to be sent to multiple people, maybe more than three people. Being able to do that and associate everybody and have just one place where we can all do that at is nice. You know, at times we have to go to different systems just because everything is not connected due to a company not being able to connect to different softwares or it just not being meshing well. I think that that was the biggest thing. I hope I answered your question in there.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:07 - 00:28:45)
Yeah, absolutely. That's really helpful. So I'm kind of picking up having that flexibility when you start working with them and a bit, you know, a willingness to adjust, to tweak to your needs are. And also then that kind of that interoperability, I suppose, you know, for having that, that fit, does that adequately reflect what you've said? So can you then think, thinking about your experiences kind of either in your current or previous company, can you think of a sales experience that you had with the shipping API vendor that either went really well, exceptionally well, or very badly? So your choice can you. Or both, if you like.
Jerrod Black (00:28:47 - 00:30:11)
I think that I mentioned reorder points at first because when I think about the shipping API, that was the biggest thing for me going back to Oracle. There is a company that makes small gift cards and trinkets and things. They're actually based out of Canada. This is one of my clients and they do two contracts a year, one at the beginning of the year and one for Christmas. Christmas is their big season. Okay. Now with this order, obviously because it's two a year, these orders are ginormous. Right. So that being said, each One of those SKUs has to be as accurate as possible just to make sure that they're shipping out to all their clients in the right portions. Because different clients obviously order different things to sell seasonal wise and just like popularity depending on region. So with that being said, Oracle at that time had actually picked up a critical, critical reorder point for to. I don't know if you ever. There's a store in America called Dollar General which is like just a dollar store.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:12 - 00:30:15)
Okay. It's like we have Poundland. It's probably.
Jerrod Black (00:30:16 - 00:31:53)
Yeah, exact same thing. Same exact thing. Right. And yeah, so like I said, these two big orders and they serve all the dollar generals in the usa. And so coincidentally enough, there was a few dollar generals in Texas versus a few dollar generals that were in, I believe they were in either North Carolina or South Carolina, I can't remember, but two different SKUs. But somehow the system caught that the SKU going to North Carolina was extremely, extremely much more lower than the, the, the reorder point going to Texas. And nobody had caught it at first. The system didn't catch it. And so it actually gave me a notification via email, via, via text, via ping, you know, just all these different types of things that kept me, that kept me updated. And it didn't only keep me updated, but literally before we got the, the order sent out, it sent me a notification to automatically update it. So therefore I really have to lift a finger. I just had to press, okay, this is the amount askew. At that point I knew exactly what numbers I wanted. So all I had to do is enter the number, press okay, and then it updated and we automatically sent that order out. Now if that didn't happen, then I would have been in trouble. It would have been just a bad.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:31:53 - 00:32:14)
So it's kind of a risk management function, I suppose, but yeah, yeah, okay, right. I'm very aware we're almost running out of allocated time. So I have a last question and this is more about pricing and value expectations. So how would you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value that it provides?
Jerrod Black (00:32:15 - 00:32:17)
Can you ask that question one more time?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:17 - 00:32:24)
Yeah, the question I have is how do you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value it provides?
Jerrod Black (00:32:25 - 00:32:32)
Oh, yes. So the value of the cargo or just about the price that I'm giving to the. The vendor.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:32 - 00:32:37)
Yeah. So that's my understanding. They're pricing their cost structure.
Jerrod Black (00:32:38 - 00:34:18)
Yeah. So how do I determine or value that? It honestly depends. I mean, for us. And I'm hoping I've answered the question correctly. So as far as the rates that we get for the vendor, we use a few different systems. I don't know. There's a system called Truck Stop, and then there's also another system that we use internally, just within Turbo that kind of helps us out with just rates and also just seeing trends over time. So is the system, which is really cool in Turbo, it actually shows you, we call them lanes. So let's say from Texas to California, it'll show like, hey, you know, this cost for this specific vendor has been this, these past three months. You know, maybe you stay in line with this, maybe you up the margin, maybe you lower the margin depending on the time of the year. And that is extremely helpful because once it just allows me to get the price back over to the customer very quickly and then also just kind of shows you how the trends and prices have either fluctuated either up or down. And yeah, it just allows me to just stay in line and just make that decision if I want to up the margin or lower the margin or. Actually, we're good right here. Let's stay here. Just depending on the sku of product.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:19 - 00:34:28)
Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. So that's all the questions I had. So. And is there anything else that you'd like to mention before we close the interview?
Jerrod Black (00:34:28 - 00:34:32)
Yeah. So how do you guys. I know you mentioned a payment. How does that. How does that work?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:33 - 00:34:46)
So, so basically now we've completed the interview and thank you very much for. That was very helpful. You'll receive an email from the rewards platform, which is called tremendous, and you should get your payment within the next 48 hours.
Jerrod Black (00:34:46 - 00:34:47)
Oh, nice. Okay.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:48 - 00:34:56)
Okay. So. So that's all I had. It's been lovely to meet you. Very, very useful interview. Thank you so much, Gerard. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Jerrod Black (00:34:56 - 00:34:57)
You do the same. Thanks so much.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:34:57 - 00:35:00)
Thank you so much. Bye bye. Bye, bye bye.

3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

1. Win/Loss Drivers: Understand why shipping API solutions are chosen, focusing on customer pain points, decision criteria, and competitive advantages (Chris W, 00:04:18-00:06:47; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25; Cody, 00:14:24-00:15:13; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49).
2. Competitor Strategies: Identify competitors’ pricing, use cases, and go-to-market tactics, particularly EasyPost’s enterprise focus and incentives (Chris O, 00:04:26-00:06:30; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:15:29-00:17:12; Aaron, 00:14:48-00:15:24).
3. Pricing and Packaging: Explore how upfront pricing compares to usage-based models and whether it deters prospects (Chase, 00:12:40-00:13:57; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35; Cody, 00:20:22-00:22:23).
4. ICP Validation: Confirm the emerging enterprise and partner ICPs (10,000–100,000 orders/month), including their specific needs and triggers (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).

Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).
2. Commoditized APIs: APIs are assumed to be seen as similar, with decisions hinging on support, documentation, or incentives (Anne, 00:12:57-00:13:26; Chase, 00:14:27-00:15:49; Cody, 00:08:27-00:10:16; Chris O, 00:15:07-00:16:25).
3. Go-to-Market Immaturity: The enterprise sales motion is assumed to lack maturity, leading to weaker brand awareness compared to EasyPost (Cody, 00:18:05-00:19:58; Chris W, 00:11:51-00:14:32; Aaron, 00:18:19-00:19:35).
4. Emerging Enterprise Fit: Emerging enterprise merchants and partners are assumed to be the ideal ICP, but specific needs require validation (Chris O, 00:11:43-00:14:12; Chase, 00:03:12-00:04:07; Anne, 00:02:40-00:03:33).
5. Support and Documentation Strength: ShipStation API’s free implementation support and dual-focused documentation are assumed to be differentiators (Anne, 00:18:24-00:20:23; Aaron, 00:20:28-00:21:16; Chase, 00:08:30-00:09:11).
6. Competitive Gaps: EasyPost and ProShip are assumed to have advantages in enterprise marketing and WMS integrations, while ShipStation API’s carrier library is a strength (Chris O, 00:06:46-00:09:59; Aaron, 00:07:20-00:08:20; Cody, 00:12:11-00:14:01).

Raw Transcript:

Buried Wins Moderator (00:06:48 - 00:09:18)
It's. Hi, Wilson.
Milton Johnson (00:09:25 - 00:09:25)
Hello.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:26 - 00:09:30)
Hi. Hello. Milton. Hi. Thank you for joining the cause. Lovely to meet you.
Milton Johnson (00:09:31 - 00:09:33)
Nice to meet you too. How are you doing this morning?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:33 - 00:09:36)
Thank you. I'm. I'm good. Well, it's afternoon for me because I'm in the uk.
Milton Johnson (00:09:37 - 00:09:38)
Oh, good afternoon.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:39 - 00:09:45)
Hi. Good morning to you. Yeah. So you're in New York, Is that where you're based or.
Milton Johnson (00:09:45 - 00:09:46)
No, I'm based in Baltimore.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:46 - 00:09:47)
Oh, Baltimore, right.
Milton Johnson (00:09:48 - 00:09:49)
Just outside of Baltimore actually.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:49 - 00:10:37)
Yeah. Okay. Well, as I say, thanks for joining us. I'll, I'll soon plunge into the questions because we've got quite a limited time to get through them. But first of all, just few preliminaries for me to go over. I always struggle with that word. So. I'm Linda. I'm working with Buried Winds, which is a third party research firm currently working with ShipStation API to improve how they serve prospects and customers. So this interview is being conducted to help ShipStation API basically learn more about your shipping API, my needs, and with your permission, I'd like to record the conversation which we share the recording along with the transcript with ShipStation API. So is that okay with you?
Milton Johnson (00:10:38 - 00:10:38)
That's fine.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:10:39 - 00:10:43)
Fantastic. Thank you. Do you have any questions for me before I get started?
Milton Johnson (00:10:44 - 00:11:23)
Just a few ads. Want to make sure that I'm. So I don't currently I'm not responsible for the, the shipping in our company. Right. We restructured, I don't know, a year ago and now shipping sits with supply chain. I'm still heavily involved in the decisions, play a part in negotiations, involved in what we're looking for when we go with a company. And I, I managed it for the first two years I was with the company, so it looked like I met all the qualifications. So I sold that in. Right. But I just wanted to be upfront that I'm not the decision maker right now.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:23 - 00:11:46)
Right. So that's absolute fine. It sounds like you'll be able to answer the questions that I have if you, you've been, and you are involved in, in that process. Really that's, that's all we need. So I'm sure that that will be fine. So could you just briefly to start, could you just, again, largely for the, the purpose also of the recording, could you very briefly just introduce yourself and your role and, and the company that you're working at?
Milton Johnson (00:11:46 - 00:11:56)
Yes, I'm Milton Johnson, I'm the director of fulfillment for Urban Stems. That's it. Do you want me to give some detail around my role or not?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:56 - 00:11:59)
Not too much. Just, just really Briefly, that's it.
Milton Johnson (00:11:59 - 00:12:08)
I mean, I'm responsible for all the day to day fulfillment operations from same day delivery to same day fulfillment.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:08 - 00:12:10)
Okay, that's great. Thank you.
Milton Johnson (00:12:11 - 00:12:17)
And then the only other question I would have, it said it was a consulting fee. How does that work? How does payment work?
Buried Wins Moderator (00:12:17 - 00:12:48)
So basically, once the interview is being completed, I understand that you should get an email from the rewards company. Tremendous. Within the next 48 hours. So I just have to confirm at the end that the interview is being completed successfully. So. Yeah. Does that answer your question there? Fantastic. Okay, then we'll get started. So first question that I have is what particular challenges or needs have prompted your company to evaluate shipping API solutions either recently or in the past?
Milton Johnson (00:12:50 - 00:13:05)
We just needed a direct line into the delivery carrier that we were using, something to automate it through our system, and it would go through the motions of printing the labels, the rates, checking the rates. That's what prompted it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:06 - 00:13:17)
Okay, and when you do, you mentioned that you have an influence in that process. So who is typically involved in evaluating shipping API solutions at your company?
Milton Johnson (00:13:18 - 00:13:21)
The supply chain manager, the people that handle the outbound logistics.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:22 - 00:13:32)
Okay, and what would be the most important criteria to you there for choosing a shipping vendor? A shipping API vendor, I should say.
Milton Johnson (00:13:34 - 00:13:38)
Service level and cost. Those probably would be the two primary things that would go into it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:13:40 - 00:13:48)
So can you talk a little bit about maybe the experience that you've had and what the process has been like in the past for you on that?
Milton Johnson (00:13:50 - 00:14:06)
I mean, we've been pretty good. So the company that we use, it's pretty standard negotiations. You enter, they tell you what services they offer. The integration. Right. The level of support that you get from a company through the integration will weigh largely on that and with the process and how it helps.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:07 - 00:14:28)
Okay. When you're coming up, like if you're looking at, say you're working obviously with a vendor at the moment, so I don't know whether you evaluated others, but if you were looking at creating a list, if you did that in the past, or you were looking at changing supplier in the future, how would you go about developing a list of possible vendors to, to evaluate?
Milton Johnson (00:14:29 - 00:15:20)
So generally we just reach out to people in the industry who they're using partners. And then once we start comparing companies together, look, cost is the easy one, right? The integration, the process, how well it integrates with our system, how compatible it is not just with our system, but any potential systems we might use if we switch. Right. So if they're only compatible with like one or two networks, It'll limit you three or four years down the road if you decide to switch another part within your organization, which happens a lot in the startup industry. Let's see what else their model, just how it works. When they're going through and they're comparing rates, how many companies they compare rates with, their success rate would probably be the big ones.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:21 - 00:15:29)
Okay. And would you kind of prioritize any of those? You mentioned compatibility? Talk quite a bit about that. I mean this. Would that be most important or would there be other factors?
Milton Johnson (00:15:31 - 00:16:06)
Cost always sits kind of high on the list depending on where your organization is. As far as with startups and things like that, compatibility would probably be second. And then with the integration. Right. It'll vary even within our organization. It's varied based on where we were at as an organization. Right. There was a time where our dev team was very big and we had a lot of people there. So the integration needing more with us wouldn't have been as big a deal. Once you start to thin out that team, the support you're going to get on that means a lot of. I would say there's probably the highest on the list.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:07 - 00:16:15)
So how has that changed in terms of the changes in your company needs? What considerations then have become more important or least important to you over time?
Milton Johnson (00:16:16 - 00:16:31)
The integration process, as we started to get more lean with our dev team, the support we're going to get on the integration process and the level of support they're going to offer you after the post integration too. Right. Weigh pretty heavily.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:16:32 - 00:16:46)
Okay. So that's become more important to you over time. Yeah. And then I want to move on and ask a little bit about your perceptions of ShipStation API, if you have any. So are you familiar with ShipStation API?
Milton Johnson (00:16:47 - 00:17:06)
I actually believe that they like I think they transitioned away from them as I was starting with the organization or just before for some reason. I remember early in my tenure with the company here in Shipstation a lot so. But I'm not 100% sure. So I don't have a lot of working knowledge with. With ShipStation.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:06 - 00:17:11)
So you don't have knowledge as to why they may have moved away from using them?
Milton Johnson (00:17:13 - 00:17:17)
I don't. Back then it would probably have been cost in several service level.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:17 - 00:17:25)
Uh huh. Okay. So they were it to your best of your knowledge that Urban Stems were actually using API Station API?
Milton Johnson (00:17:25 - 00:17:38)
At least there was talks about it. I'm talking. I started with the organization over six years ago, so almost seven years ago. So the name just rings. Sounds really familiar to me. Like they Used to talk about it when I first started.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:39 - 00:17:52)
Okay, that's interesting. So given what you may or may not know about ShipStation API, do you have any particular perceptions in terms of what their strengths, their main strengths, or any weaknesses might be?
Milton Johnson (00:17:52 - 00:17:53)
I do not.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:17:53 - 00:18:07)
Okay, that's fine. And then when you. Again, I don't know to what extent you were involved in the process for appointing the current or selecting the current, current vendor, but do you know whether Shipstation API was considered during that evaluation?
Milton Johnson (00:18:10 - 00:18:21)
I. I do not that I would say. I would have. Say it had to have been because they wouldn't have been talking about it if not. Right. So I would. I would. I would say yes, but I couldn't say for certain.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:22 - 00:18:35)
Mm. Again, I guess then no knowledge as to why it was. Wasn't pursued at that point. Okay, that's fine. Do you think that you would consider Shipstation API future evaluation?
Milton Johnson (00:18:35 - 00:18:37)
Oh, I don't see why not.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:18:39 - 00:18:45)
Okay. Any particular reasons that come to mind in terms, again, your perceptions, any positive perceptions that you have of them?
Milton Johnson (00:18:46 - 00:18:59)
So I'm generally, like, when I'm vetting vendors, I don't really exclude any companies that I haven't had a bad experience with or somebody that I, that, that I know personally and has worked with them has given me feedback about a really bad experience.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:00 - 00:19:01)
Okay.
Milton Johnson (00:19:01 - 00:19:06)
To at least, at least have initial call to consider. Just make sure they meet all the basic parameters of what you're looking for. Right.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:07 - 00:19:20)
So is there anything you'd say, say, like one of your industry contacts came to you and said, like, oh, would you consider ShipStation API? Because we're looking at using them. Is there anything that comes to mind in the. In terms of any advice or thoughts that you might give to them?
Milton Johnson (00:19:22 - 00:19:29)
No, I don't have enough of a working opinion to really give knowledge about them one way or the other.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:29 - 00:19:52)
That's fine. Fair enough. Thank you. All right, then I'll move on. The next set of questions I had is really more about competitors and competitor comparisons. So can I ask, like, again, to the best of your knowledge or processes, you've been involved in which shipping API vendors you have evaluated in the past or even are just aware of and you feel able to talk about a bit.
Milton Johnson (00:19:53 - 00:19:54)
Easy Post is a big one.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:19:57 - 00:19:59)
All right. And what do you know about easypost?
Milton Johnson (00:20:00 - 00:20:23)
Their rates are competitive, they have a good service level, they're compatible with all the big. With all the big guys and a lot of the smaller local services like CDL and One Track, some of the more regional carriers that generally give you better rates than FedEx or UPS.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:23 - 00:20:26)
So can I ask, are you using EasyPost at the moment?
Milton Johnson (00:20:26 - 00:20:27)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:27 - 00:20:38)
Yep. Okay. And how about any other API shipping API vendors you've come across? Do you have any, any others bring to mind that you may have? No.
Milton Johnson (00:20:38 - 00:20:40)
Easypost is kind of like the big guy in the space.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:41 - 00:20:48)
Okay. Have you heard of, for example, a couple of other names I've got here, Shippo Pro Ship.
Milton Johnson (00:20:49 - 00:20:58)
So I have heard of shippo. I don't have a lot of, like, working knowledge with them, though. We've never vetted them as an operation, so.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:59 - 00:21:03)
Okay. So no. Any particular perceptions, so. Of them?
Milton Johnson (00:21:04 - 00:21:04)
Not really.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:05 - 00:21:11)
Okay. All right. So really easy post was the. I suppose the outstanding.
Milton Johnson (00:21:12 - 00:21:13)
Yes.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:15 - 00:21:15)
Okay.
Milton Johnson (00:21:16 - 00:21:28)
We've been using it for quite some time now. We're happy with them. We don't have a lot of issues with them. I don't know how useful I'm going to be for this because we've been using who we've been using for a while.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:21:28 - 00:21:46)
No, it's all useful. It's very helpful to talk to people in all kinds of circumstances, if you like, in terms of their usage of shipping API solutions. Can you talk to me a bit more then about that beyond the initial evaluation and selection, you know what that relationship's been like.
Milton Johnson (00:21:46 - 00:22:16)
Why, why the integration went pretty smoothly. We haven't had any issues with them as far as service level. You've had some hiccups where you might bring a new vendor on and some of the code between the two organizations. There might be a break in the code somewhere. They're usually pretty responsive, though. We have a direct contact. That's, that's one of the, the big things that I would say for organizations. Right. Is to have a direct contact when there's an issue.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:16 - 00:22:17)
Yeah.
Milton Johnson (00:22:17 - 00:22:26)
Somebody that, that is kind of familiar with your organization and how you operate that can help streamline the solution. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:27 - 00:22:48)
And then on kind of leads to the next type of questions I had on the sales and support expectations. So, I mean, are there things that you would really like shipping API vendors to understand about your company and its needs that would enable them to kind of address those. Those better? Perhaps. Perhaps give you a wider playing field to choose from?
Milton Johnson (00:22:49 - 00:22:50)
I'm sorry, say that one more time.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:22:50 - 00:23:07)
So are there other things about your company that you wish site. So the various shipping API vendors that are out there, are there things that you would ideally like them to understand more about your company and its particular shipping needs so that they could develop maybe a better solution to meet those needs?
Milton Johnson (00:23:08 - 00:23:51)
Yes. I mean, you Always want the vendor that you're dealing with to understand your company and how it's going to work within their systems. Our, our shipping method isn't very complex, so it's not like there's a whole lot to understand with us. Right. But when you're dealing with a company, you want them to understand you. What you're looking for. Responsiveness is always a big one. Right. Like you want to feel like your salesman. You want to feel like you matter to them. Right. That's probably one of the big ones. Right. If you, if you start with a company and it's taking a salesman two or three days to get back to you and things like that, or they're just not holding true on timelines, it will put a bad taste in your mouth right away, or at least for me.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:51 - 00:24:11)
And yeah, I mean, although you say your needs are not that complex, but I would imagine like in, in your industry, obviously you're shipping perishable items, you know, fresh flowers and that. I mean, are there, are there particular needs related to that and the types of, of items that you are shipping that would, that would have an influence on the type of solution that you'd need?
Milton Johnson (00:24:12 - 00:24:41)
So our internal system kind of does a lot of the legwork. It guarantees that everything's going to make it next day and it'll automatically push through that and then it'll go into the API and it'll give us the best method, whether it's express or ground, and it just prints the label. So it's not our internal network, does most of the work as far as what location that's going to come out of and the method is going to ship.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:42 - 00:25:09)
I guess that's why the compatibility and the integration is particularly important then for you, that it matches up with your system. Yeah, I get that. And have you had any experience? I know, I appreciate. You say you've been working with Easy Post for some years and you're happy with that relationship. Have you had any perhaps previous experiences with the shipping API vendor that didn't go so well that even just evaluating them that, you know, you could talk about?
Milton Johnson (00:25:10 - 00:25:12)
Honestly, I can't say that I have.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:12 - 00:25:17)
Okay. Or any conversely, any other really positive experiences in the past that.
Milton Johnson (00:25:18 - 00:25:39)
I mean, my interactions with easypost have been very positive. Through the negotiations there, it wasn't a whole lot of back and forth. We got pretty good rates coming in. And again, the few times that we've had, like, system issues, we've been able to reach out to them and it's been handled pretty Promptly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:40 - 00:25:59)
Okay. Yeah. So that, that's, that sales, that access to support seems to be really important. Yeah. And what about, you know, we. In terms of pricing? I mean, do you question I have is like, how do you assess whether a vendor's pricing aligns with the value it provides?
Milton Johnson (00:25:59 - 00:26:34)
Your company comparison. Right. Like what you're going to get versus what it's, what, what the market rate is when it comes to like shipping. I hate this. A lot of the, the features they offer are all the same. Right. Like it's, it's, it's a very competitive market and you have a lot of newer guys trying to squeeze in, but there isn't anybody, at least to my knowledge, that's doing anything like super innovative in the market. Right. It's. You're almost always kind of comparing apples to apples when you're, when you're going through the process.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:26:35 - 00:26:50)
Although I suppose there are some differences to an extent in terms of pricing models and structures. So for example, I'm thinking like, what about having an upfront pricing model as opposed to a pay as you go type model? Do, do you have thoughts or preferences on that?
Milton Johnson (00:26:53 - 00:27:06)
It just depends on the business structure. For, for us, probably want the upfront so that you can work it into your budget and getting price per package. I'm sorry, I have to. This is an emergency.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:06 - 00:27:07)
Oh, yeah.
Milton Johnson (00:27:08 - 00:27:16)
Hey, Trees, can I call you. Can I call you right back? Is it important? Okay. All right. Sorry.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:16 - 00:27:24)
It's okay. Yeah, so we're just talking about pricing, I think you were saying kind of again, depends on the company. And the.
Milton Johnson (00:27:24 - 00:27:37)
It just depends on. So internal. Depends on what you're looking for as an organization. For us, it works to have the upfront pricing and you just break it out throughout the course of the year. So, you know, so you know what you're paying per package.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:37 - 00:28:10)
Sure. Yeah. Okay, let me see. Well, I think we've actually covered most of the main questions I had. I want to make the most of the time if possible and, and take it up to the, to the half hour. I mean, while I'm looking through my list, is there anything else that comes to mind to you that again, bearing in mind the purpose of the interview, and we're helping ShipStation API not, not, not just in terms of your company, but kind of improve the overall solution that it delivers like, like companies to your. So anything you can add, anything you can suggest or.
Milton Johnson (00:28:10 - 00:29:07)
I mean, obviously the big thing would be like any way that they can help with costing. Right. Like where they can save money. Right. Like that for us, if we were going to switch to a different organization, that would be the driving factor at this point. Right. Is what can you do that the current vendor is not doing to save money on a per package. Right. Whether that's the shipping method a lot of companies will use, they're not. We focus on regional and one major carrier. A lot of companies, they just want the best rate. Right. So the things that you're doing, they'll ship U.S. mail, they'll ship FedEx, UPS, a regional carrier, they don't really care who's shipping it. Our models is a little bit different. The things that they can do to maximize savings in those ways would be probably the biggest thing. Right. That's what most companies are going to be looking for.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:07 - 00:29:17)
Yeah. Yeah. All right. And is there anything kind of in the area of sort of packaging, labeling or whatever or is that just again, not really relevant? Because it's more your, your system that.
Milton Johnson (00:29:18 - 00:29:34)
It doesn't really matter for us if they can help. For a lot of companies who use our packages standard. Right. But if they can recommend or they're stir, they're pushing through the most efficient, cost effective packaging, that would go a long way too.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:36 - 00:29:52)
Okay. And at the moment, like say your perception, I guess, and what you've said is that there's really not that much difference. You're happy with the relationship you have currently post and there's nothing that's standing out there in, in the market to kind of differentiate. Any other, Any other.
Milton Johnson (00:29:52 - 00:29:54)
No, not that I've seen over the last six months or a year.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:56 - 00:30:40)
That's interesting to know there. Okay, let's see if I can fill in the time with anything else. So we've got, we've got through my main questions you've answered very helpfully, very succinctly. So we've got through the main questions fairly quickly. Yeah, I mean, I think that's, that's probably the most that I can ask you, to be honest. I don't think I've missed anything. Yeah, no, unless to say you've covered everything, you've talked a lot. Unless there's anything else on, on the current solution that, that you're really happy with. But you've talked a lot about that already, so I think we, we're probably in a position to tie up the interview a couple of minutes early.
Milton Johnson (00:30:41 - 00:30:43)
All right, thank you. I appreciate the time today.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:44 - 00:30:54)
Yeah, no, thank, thank you so much for joining me. It's been lovely to meet you, Milton, and really helpful interview. And like I say, you should receive an email from Tre within the next 48 hours. I understand.
Milton Johnson (00:30:55 - 00:30:56)
Okay. All right. You have a nice day.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:30:56 - 00:30:59)
And you, too. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

Common Assumptions Across Stakeholders
1. Pricing as a Barrier: Upfront pricing (e.g., $20,000 annually) is assumed to deter prospects, especially partners and smaller enterprises, compared to EasyPost’s flexible models (Chase, 00:12:13-00:12:31; Aaron, 00:15:50-00:16:22; Chris W, 00:15:55-00:17:35).

Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:07 - 00:03:09)
Lovely. Really, really nice. Always wanted to go.
Mark Taylor (00:03:10 - 00:03:27)
Well now is. It's been. While it has been a very somewhat mild July, it's still hot and I would suggest sometime probably mid to late October or March and April are really magical here.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:03:27 - 00:04:13)
So lovely. Very, very nice. Awesome. Well Mark, thanks for joining me today. So I'm with Berry Wins and we're a third party research firm working with shipstation API to basically improve how they serve their prospects and customers. The interview is being recorded by Shipstation. Just basically learn a bit more about your API needs. So just with your permission, I'd just like to record the company conversation. Absolutely, absolutely perfect. It's only going to be shared with Shipstation to basically help them and then further understand the needs. So I'm just going to run through a quick couple of questions that we have. Do you have any questions before we start?
Mark Taylor (00:04:14 - 00:04:16)
Nope, I do not.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:04:16 - 00:04:22)
Absolutely. Fine. Perfect. Well just to begin with, would you be able to just introduce yourself and your company?
Mark Taylor (00:04:23 - 00:07:33)
Yep, absolutely. My name is Mark Taylor, CEO of Warehouse Republic. We started, I started third party selling on Amazon in 2015 and started looking into how to control my own supply chain needs a little bit more intensely around 2016 17. We figured it out for our own needs and then started offering it to other Amazon sellers in 2018. And you know, at the time there weren't very many small 3pls that you know, had a good online presence where you could find them. So we started offering kind of the small medium sized business option for FBA and our niche at the time was specific to fulfilled by Amazon and it wasn't until about 2022, you know, where we got the confirmation that we were very right about the need when Amazon warehousing and distribution started offering services basically to our exact client set. And so since then, you know, we've been working on a pivot to really kind of more fulfill the needs of omnichannel sellers. Of course we still do FBA prep, but we support sellers mostly through extensive wms. We have relationship with one other WMS right now that brings clients to us called Soapbox Soapboxes. We work with a few, I'd probably say four or five clients that like I said, they've brought specifically to us. But those clients are utilizing Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Nordstrom's, Shopify and a couple other smaller sites. On the extensive WMS side of things, our API connections are primarily Shopify, but also some Fair which is like a wholesaler marketplace. We've had Macy's through API, we've had WooCommerce, BigCommerce, some of the other things through API connections. And then our current shipping situation, we have a partnership with a company called iDrive and iDrive has built their own TMS. And so up until recently we were using Tech Dynamics, their version of their TMS called Techship and we use that for about four or five years and ran our own accounts through it. IDRIVE basically brought a much better account relationship with UPS, FedEx, USPS, Amazon shipping, DHL, E Com and then a lot of local and regional carriers if we want them. So you know, we're always looking. We do have, we do run EDI as well. We've run EDI with Amazon vendor program. We've run EDI with you know, a few other things. But I mean most of what we do I'd say is heavily weighted probably about 80% toward API connections through for marketplace integration.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:07:34 - 00:07:42)
Nice. And what challenges or kind of needs prompted you to evaluate a solution for an API?
Mark Taylor (00:07:44 - 00:09:19)
Well, I mean you have to at this point the majority, I would say that the majority of commerce is probably still on edi. I would say, I mean like now if you, if you. And what I mean by that is like Walmart, Walmart's still on edi. Amazon like the big Amazon sellers are going through edi. Target is edi Sportsman, Warehouse, Back, Bass Pro, Shop Shields. All of those clients are still running primarily EDI relationships for your bigger business to business relationships as you do more direct consumer in the small and B small and medium sized business side of things. It's way skewed towards API and at the beginning before. So a really big boon for us was when Extensive purchased Cart Rover Extensive used to be called 3PL Central their three people, their, their WMS program is still called, they call it 3P internally but it's extensive WMS and what they did was you know, they had some private equity company came and bought them and then also purchase Cart Rover which they have turned into and they call it now Integration Manager. And up until that point anytime we wanted to connect Shopify or anything, we even have Tech Dynamics, we had a former customer that ran a shipstation integration and in order to integrate it to Shipstation we had to use them as basically to build the API bridge.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:09:20 - 00:09:49)
Got it. Yeah, I just want to push, push slightly on that one because you said obviously the DTC is massively skewed. I know this might seem like an obvious answer to you but just so that I've pulled up, why is it that DTC is skewed towards API? Is it because the sheer volume isn't practical to be able to pass on and it needs to be automated because otherwise it'd create too much work. What's the kind of the rationale behind it? What's the, what's, what's the pain point?
Mark Taylor (00:09:49 - 00:11:41)
API call API calls are seemingly, are seemingly a lot more accessible to small and medium sized businesses and in order, in order to you know Shopify being the biggest one, I mean I would say the biggest small and medium sized business hosting like web platform for people to host their E commerce sites like and that's all API calls. So they, you know shop, Shopify has done. They're one of the only API providers in the space. In fact they. And when I say one of the only. I think they're the only one that I know of. That doesn't mean anything other than just that's just my knowledge base that has gone through and developed routing for multi node warehouses. And so we have an east coast facility and a west coast facility and we have about five, five of our larger, of our, you know, larger that are still very much considered medium sized businesses but they're large to us that are, that are utilizing both, both hubs and Shopify right now is the only. Sorry, yeah, Shopify is the only technology out there that has done the order routing where it's like internally they have you know, the zip codes of each, they know what the shipping zones are going to be. And so when there's product in both locations and an order comes through here and it's you know, it's in New Hampshire, great. It's going to route the order to North Carolina. If it's in Oregon, it's going to route the order to California. That shipping logic has only been developed by Shopify to my knowledge and everybody else trying to keep up like that's, you know, that's and they're doing it through API. So.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:11:41 - 00:11:49)
And if it's small businesses that typically use APIs, is that the reason that they or Shopify, that's why they make use of the API?
Mark Taylor (00:11:50 - 00:14:02)
Certainly. I mean I would have to think it's the accessibility of it, it's the flexibility of it and you know like even extensive has made. They've, they're not an open source platform but they do have several open APIs. Now EDI is also very legacy and this is just my opinion, EDI seems very very legacy and you've got the big boys really wanting to preserve their ability to control those workflows because I mean like even today in this incredibly tech enabled environment that we live in like this age with all the AI and all the, you know, all the, the predictive analytics that are coming in and you still, it takes, it is still a six week kind of best case scenario to engage with like an SBS Commerce and an extensive and you know, whoever is on the client side netsuite, whoever it may be to get an EDI integration built. So you know, for the three PL and you know you're talking about just on the development side of things and these are pre wired integrations. There's nothing new about this. There's the calls aren't custom but putting these things in place and making sure the testing works and the client's got all the correct pieces of data in. It's a $10,000 lift just to get SPS and extensive aligned. And that's just from our side, I don't know, it depends on what you know the component is. And then of course it's a, it's monthly maintenance fees of you know, SPS charges 625 a connection that you know, with the deal that we have, I mean I'm, I don't know if that's standard or what but. And then extensive of course requires us to pay an additional 200 bucks a month for the UCC Label Access, UCC 128 Label Access and then another few hundred dollars a month for the EDI enablement. So I mean it's you know, it's easily you know between 600 and $1,000 a month just to maintain that connection.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:14:02 - 00:14:11)
Thank you very much indeed. And who's typically involved in evaluating the shipping API solutions at your company? Is that you? Is that someone else? Tumblr.
Mark Taylor (00:14:12 - 00:15:07)
So my co founder is very kind of tech forward. He's taken a much, a much lesser role in the last year. But you know, if I, if I need him for anything, he's, he's got the ability to, he has a little, you know, his code writing experience, he's got all that kind of stuff. But he's also been, you know, in the blockchain world for a long time. You know, last 10, 15 years. And yeah, I guess, I guess it would be 10 to 15 years. But anyway, he's been, he's been in, in the blockchain crypto world for a long time. And so he's on the, on the forefront of like, what's going on and he has helped evaluated things and kind of pointed us in the right direction and then most of the stuff at this point, I know our goal and I can relatively easily evaluate what, what's required and at least have the right contractors in place to call upon if we do need help.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:08 - 00:15:10)
And he's, and he's your cto?
Mark Taylor (00:15:11 - 00:15:24)
No, he's just, I mean, he's CEO business, you know, co founder, you know, kind of wears a bunch of different hats. When I say he doesn't take a big role. I mean, we have conversations about the business where I need his help two or three times a year at this point.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:15:25 - 00:15:35)
That's awesome. Thank you. And what are the most important criteria for choosing a shipping API vendor when you're doing the evaluation?
Mark Taylor (00:15:38 - 00:18:01)
Well, I mean, let's talk about where we're at right now. I mean, right, right now Tech Ship has gotten, you know, they were great, they were a great option for a long time. They enabled rate shopping, they enabled us to use our own, our own accounts. Like we could just plug in our account numbers. We could mark it up customer to customer, we could mark it up service. You know, they've now enabled to enable it to where if you have a data scientist on your, on your payroll, you can tweak, you know, 20 facets of every single customer profile in shipping and you can rate shop and you can write preferences and rules and this and that. I don't have, I don't have the, the capacity for a data scientist or somebody like, you know, somebody who can be that into the shipping aspect of it. So, you know, part, part of why I, you know, moved away from Tech ship was because we were our, our fair clients. Basically the way you have to do it with fair is like whenever you ship something, the, the shipping software writes back like what the cost is. And as soon as the tracking numbers relayed back to fair's platform, it's also relaying back the shipping information. And what we found with our previous tech ship integration or, you know, situation was they weren't accurately because they didn't have access to the meter, they didn't have access to the contract, the dim divisors, any of the, you know, surcharges, you know, whether they were 50% surcharges, whether they were full surcharges, whether they were, you know, residential rule, whatever, they didn't have that level of access. So they couldn't write back appropriately. The real landed car, like the real cost of shipping a package. So they might write back, all right, well, if the packages, you know, $10 to ship and we mark it up 20% to the customer, well, it might have been a base rate of $10. And then they weren't adding the fuel surcharge, the peak surcharge, anything. And so it's like all of a sudden, you know, we wrote back to the customer that it was a 12 package to ship.
Mark Taylor (00:18:01 - 00:20:03)
And when we get the bill from UPS or FedEx, they would say, oh, I was actually seen when you add everything in. And so we had clients basically looking at us and saying, look, you guys need to eat that $4, because you said it was 12 and it was 16. So when we went to partner with iDrive, the really big draw was the fact that they owned the meter. They, they actively negotiate all the contracts. So it's like we're kind of under their umbrella. And they had all of that written into their, to their, their TMS software. So when it writes back 1543, what we see on the bill is 1543. So that level of like clarity and transparency of communication back to the FAIR platform meant that we were billing our customers correctly. So that was, that was huge. And in addition to that, they're doing land, you know, the actual cost with all the surcharges and everything with, including, you know, and allowing for Rate shop, which is also, you know, it's a big, it's a big, it's a big business. I mean, it's a, it's a big thing for our customers to be able to do that, to know that they're getting, you know, because it's like in, in the 2 to 8, in the 2 to 20 pound range. Amazon shipping right now smokes the crush. But you get to a 35 pound package, dim weight or, or real actual shipping rate weight. And now you're looking at, you know, I mean, UPS or FedEx may do it depending on where it is. And so having the ability to go to your customer and say, okay, well like here are your four bills. You know, we ship these on USPS, we ship these on Amazon, we ship these FedEx, these US, UPS, it really helped them understand that like they're getting potentially, you know, they're getting the best possible, you know, shipping rate that they can get.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:04 - 00:20:12)
So, so you can transmit that to the customer and show them these are the different rates you can go for. So you could be at that level of transparency.
Mark Taylor (00:20:13 - 00:20:53)
Yes, and frankly, the reporting system is quite good for the iDrive TMS. So I mean, like just that transparency and reporting. And look, we have an arrangement with them where they effectively bill us. And out of that bill I pass it on to the customer with maybe a markup or not a markup. Ideally what I do is I introduce my customers directly to iDrive and iDrive just bills them. IDrive has built in a markup into the rates that are being shown back to the customer and then we take a 30% cut of that markup and then they just remit it to us at the first of each month.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:20:53 - 00:21:08)
That's brilliant. And what kind of specific reporting and analytics features do you need from a shipping API that specifically list in mind?
Mark Taylor (00:21:10 - 00:23:25)
Yeah, I mean, look, if you can. Firstly, the big carriers are really sucking wind right now because they're, they're just showing adjustment fees. And even with the most sophisticated shipping software out there, you have to go back to UPS to ask for clarification on why there's an adjustment. And you know, I think showing people, you know, when you think about the data that the customer needs to like increase their customer experience as from the perspective of A3PL, you want to be able to like have like a map out there, like shows the heat map of where everything is going. And if you've got a bike, if you've got, you know, multiple nodes for your warehouses, you want to be able to like relay, you want to add that, that additive information back to your customer says, hey, I know we've got 60% of your goods concentrated in California, but we should really swap that and do 65% of your goods in North Carolina, 35% in California, and here's why. Or if you've got, you know, east, mid and west, you should be able to say, we need to now put 20 in Dallas, you know, 40 in the East coast and then 40 on the West Coast. And this is why, like Giving that level of transparency to your customers is, is very, very, it's necessary. Giving them the, you know, shipping breakdowns as to why you went, you know, with the, with these things with, with these particular carriers is a good one. Also evaluative things. So it's like, you know, if you're just going off of a rate shop, maybe USPS is beating FedEx by 20 cents, but FedEx's service is so much better that it's absolutely worth 20 cents to just go ahead and ship everything. So that on hand information that says shipping with FedEx, even though it's a little bit more expensive, it's only this much more expensive. And we believe that, that you're getting what you pay for. And it more than justifies shipping with FedEx. Like you want to be, to give them those, those up to date numbers very, very quickly.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:23:26 - 00:23:39)
That's awesome. And when you're kind of building a list of people you wanted to kind of evaluate who were in the shipping API space, did you already know the people you wanted to speak to? Did you research it? Did you Google it?
Mark Taylor (00:23:41 - 00:24:05)
Yeah, we had a relationship from Tech Ship a long time ago because I spoke with a guy who was very, very, very solid in the industry. We kind of subleased a portion of a building that he, that his company was in. And I mean, he was just smart and I didn't Even know what APIs were at the time. And he said, look, we've evaluated a lot of providers. These are the guys to use. They're incredibly cheap, they give a great product.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:24:06 - 00:24:06)
Okay, cool.
Mark Taylor (00:24:07 - 00:25:05)
So started a relationship with them. It worked pretty well. They grew pretty significant. That's Tech Ship or Tech Tech Dynamics. They're a Canadian company. They grew really, really significantly on 22 and 23 and like had some pretty, pretty gnarly growing pains. And then that kind of pushed me to evaluate what Extensive was offering. And we basically looked, we basically went from, we basically went from like $450 a connection to get a Shopify integration built up and like, you know, four to six weeks worth of time to being able to set up, you know, integrations on our own within 30 minutes if we have the right API keys using Extensive's thing, using their API. And so that was such a leap forward that. And, and because it's like I know all the people at Extensive at this point and built relationships with them, I haven't had to seek out other people today.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:06 - 00:25:12)
Okay, so you haven't had to. And are you familiar with Shipstation?
Mark Taylor (00:25:12 - 00:25:20)
Yeah, of course. We've I mean, as I said at the beginning, like we had, we've had integrations with shipstation on behalf of some of our customers.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:25:21 - 00:25:23)
And what's your possession of them? Just briefly.
Mark Taylor (00:25:25 - 00:27:27)
I think ShipStation was first mover in, in this, I mean, maybe not first Mover, but they were one of the early ones that really caught traction with label generation, allowing you to, what they did really, really well was they built these integrations for all these different platforms to then generate label creation, translate label creation from those platforms. And they really stayed in their lane. They said, we're not going to screw with being a source of truth for inventory levels. We're simply going to say if we believe that it's, that you have the inventory, like then it can sell, but you're going to be responsible for transmitting that all back to your platforms. And so they were the original, I think, I mean since I've been doing this for the last seven, seven and a half years, they were one of the original companies out there that just understood we're going to build, we're going to learn how to translate from all these different sites. And it was very, very, very, very smart. They stayed in their lane. They said, we're not going to be a wms, we're not going to track inventory on your behalf. And I think they've done a great job of, you know, making a ton of money sitting in their lane. I haven't looked at, I don't know if they're public, I haven't looked at their thing but I mean my interpretation is like they have, they've, they've maintained decent overhead and what I'm gathering by this even being prompted on this call is they've been too comfortable on their laurels for too long and now they've looked up and a bunch of other people offer the exact same thing. Don't have the, the market dominance, don't have the market, you know, the, they're not. Nobody else is the Coca Cola of the industry quite like Shipstation maybe, but they got an innovator. They're just, you know, or they've got to milk it until it dies.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:27:28 - 00:27:36)
What do you reckon their strengths and weaknesses are just from your perspective rather than from a market. Yeah.
Mark Taylor (00:27:36 - 00:28:42)
So in this space, what, what a lot of people do is they go after this feature rich environment of being able to, you know, we're going to do this and we're going to do this and we're going to do it on a Sunday when it's raining outside. I mean, it's like they offer all these features and they all work half ass. And what I think shipstation has done really, really well is the features that they say, like they make sure it works, it runs on rails before releasing it seemingly. And that I think that very intense focus on staying in your lane, not tracking inventory, not going after the WMS piece of things has served them well. But I also think it served him so well that it's like there may have been like a little bit of reticence to innovate and reticence to kind of keep up with the market and really chase the next big thing. And so, you know, in the seven years I've been doing it, they were crushing it. I mean, you know, crushing it I think in 18, 19, 20. And then it's just, they've, I think, I think a lot of other people have caught up.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:28:42 - 00:28:47)
Did you consider them when you were last evaluating which API to take on?
Mark Taylor (00:28:48 - 00:29:38)
No, because it's a little clunky to add them and run all the API calls basically through them to our WMS and then basically write everything back. And then also it doesn't align with. As far as I know you can get some negotiated rates through them, but you can't get the negotiated rates like I've got, like they were. I don't think they would have brought me Amazon Shipping with the, with a pre negotiated contract. I don't think I'd have the discounts I have with UPS with us, sorry, UPS or FedEx. And then they don't seem to have an outbound like we're negotiating these contracts on your behalf really aggressively every single quarter.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:29:40 - 00:29:42)
Okay, fair enough. I mean, would you ever consider them?
Mark Taylor (00:29:43 - 00:32:14)
Yeah, if it were, if, I mean if it, if it demonstrated more value than my current system and it simplified things. Absolutely like that. But the thing is, is like it's not only, you know, one of the things that I have worked out that nobody seems to understand how important it is is my current partnership. They take the working, they, they take the burden of working capital. And so when we blow up, they've got this massive line of credit that they can just absolutely draw on charge. My customers float it and they've got the resources to do all the billing once a week like two days after, you know, they get the bill from UPS, FedEx, etc for all of my clients, it gets billed or, and it gets either comes to me and I have to build a customer and then deal with it or for the majority of our shipping at this point they build a customer directly And I don't have to worry about it. And then I just collect back a check at the first of the month for the margin. And why that makes, why that's such a huge difference is because if all I'm doing is they're taking all the financial risk and I'm getting a 10,000, 20,000, $30,000 check, whatever it may be at the beginning of every month, that goes straight to my profit line. There's no, I, I didn't have to create, I didn't have to generate any revenue for that profit. And that is, I mean that, that's literally taking it from where like if you look at a 3 PL operation and I do have to go, but if you look at a 3 PL operation and let's say they do a million dollars in service revenue and they get 15% on that, they do a million dollars in shipping revenue and they take 10% on that. Well they're blended. Their blended profitability is going to be 12.5% and like you can't. But it's like in my case what I'm doing is I'm getting, I'm getting, let's say, you know, service revenue, a million dollars, profits, $150,000, 15% and then just out of nowhere let's say we get 10% on a million dollars in shipping. Well now that makes it look like, you know, that's $100,000. So now it's $250,000. But I only had a million dollars of revenue. Like I didn't have, I didn't have to like put out that, that million bucks for the 10%. So it's like my profits look much far better.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:15 - 00:32:19)
What could, what could shipstation do to get you that?
Mark Taylor (00:32:20 - 00:32:36)
I mean that's a, I don't know how many clients shipstation has, but I mean, you know, they have to have a massive banking relationship and be able to like basically take on the financial, the, the working capital aspect of it.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:32:36 - 00:32:50)
Interesting. But I suppose my only last question is what would kind of make any one API shipping kind of company basically stand out?
Mark Taylor (00:32:52 - 00:33:21)
Well, I mean at this point it's number of APIs and ease of connection and that's it. It's just like they're constantly more and more and more out there and I mean honestly I think the next big frontier is using all this tech enabled stuff that we've got and just killing edi, like figuring out what to do to absolutely just kill that dinosaur of a system.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:22 - 00:33:27)
Amazing. And the key strength you'd kind of consider yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mark Taylor (00:33:28 - 00:33:31)
All right. I'm two minutes late to the team meet. It's great to meet you. I hope you have a wonderful day.
Buried Wins Moderator (00:33:31 - 00:33:32)
I appreciate it.
Mark Taylor (00:33:32 - 00:33:33)
