## Implementation Components

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompt** (`create_best_in_class_system_prompt`)

The system prompt provides comprehensive instructions for generating research-quality responses:

#### **Data Context Integration**
```python
# Build comprehensive themes summary
themes_summary = ""
for theme in client_data.get('themes', []):
    theme_statement = theme.get('theme_statement', theme.get('theme_name', 'N/A'))
    theme_strength = theme.get('theme_strength', theme.get('theme_confidence', 'N/A'))
    companies_affected = theme.get('companies_affected', theme.get('theme_companies_affected', 1))
    
    themes_summary += f"**Theme: {theme_statement}**\n"
    themes_summary += f"  - Strength: {theme_strength}\n"
    themes_summary += f"  - Companies Affected: {companies_affected}\n"
```

#### **Response Framework Requirements**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level answer with key metrics
- **Evidence-Based Insights**: Specific theme/finding references
- **Direct Evidence**: Full attribution for all quotes
- **Strategic Context**: Business impact and implications
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Supporting evidence for each

### 2. **Citation Requirements**

#### **For Every Claim**
- **Theme Reference**: "Supported by Theme: [Theme Name] (Strength: X/10)"
- **Finding Reference**: "Based on Finding: [Finding Statement] (Confidence: X/10)"
- **Quote Attribution**: "Quote from [Company Name] - [Interviewee Name]"
- **Impact Metrics**: "Impact Score: X/5, Companies Affected: Y"

#### **For Every Quote**
- **Full Attribution**: Company name, interviewee name, context
- **Confidence Level**: Based on finding confidence score
- **Business Context**: What this quote reveals about the business

### 3. **Response Structure**

#### **Example Response Format**
```
**Executive Summary:**
[Clear, high-level answer with key metrics and confidence levels]

**Key Insights:**
â€¢ [Insight 1] - Supported by Theme: [Theme Name] (Strength: X/10), Confidence: Y/10
â€¢ [Insight 2] - Based on Finding: [Finding Statement] (Confidence: X/10), Impact: Y/5

**Direct Evidence:**
â€¢ "[Specific quote]" â€” [Company Name], [Interviewee Name] (Confidence: X/10)
â€¢ "[Specific quote]" â€” [Company Name], [Interviewee Name] (Confidence: X/10)

**Strategic Implications:**
[Connect to broader business impact and executive themes]

**Recommended Actions:**
1. [Action 1] - Priority: [High/Medium/Low], Impact: [High/Medium/Low], Evidence: [Theme/Finding Reference]
2. [Action 2] - Priority: [High/Medium/Low], Impact: [High/Medium/Low], Evidence: [Theme/Finding Reference]
```

"""
```

### **Data Integration**
```python
def get_client_data(client_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Fetch all relevant data for a specific client with enhanced context."""
    try:
        # Get themes with full context
        themes = supabase.table('stage4_themes').select('*').eq('client_id', client_id).execute()
        
        # Get findings with enhanced data
        findings = supabase.table('stage3_findings').select('*').eq('client_id', client_id).execute()
        
        # Get responses with metadata
