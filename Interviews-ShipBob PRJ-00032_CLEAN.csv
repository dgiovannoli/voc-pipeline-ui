IVW-00123,ShipBob,Nick Codispoti,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Nick Codispoti, Operations at Metro Vein Centers
Company Snapshot Metro Vein Centers is a mid-market healthcare services provider headquartered in West Bloomfield, Michigan, offering minimally invasive medical and cosmetic treatments for varicose veins, spider veins, and other venous conditions to adult patients across the United States through a national network of 60 accredited clinics.
Primer Nick evaluated ShipBob for automating patient package fulfillment but shifted to a specialized print shop solution.
Perspective HIPAA compliance requirements created an immediate deal-breaker. Metro Vein Centers needed a fulfillment partner capable of handling private patient data flowing through their system, which required HIPAA-compliant agreements and security protocols that ShipBob couldn't provide. The company ultimately pivoted from a traditional 3PL model to a print shop solution that could handle their unique requirements for personalized patient packages sent to 60 clinics nationwide. This shift eliminated the need for pre-packaged inventory in favor of on-demand printing of clinic-specific letters, appointment cards, and brochures.
Pulse • HIPAA compliance gap — ShipBob lacked required healthcare data security protocols → immediate disqualification from consideration
• Print shop pivot — Metro Vein Centers shifted from 3PL fulfillment to automated printing → eliminated inventory management complexity
• Positive sales experience — ShipBob demonstrated creativity and professionalism despite poor fit → would be reconsidered for future non-HIPAA projects

Transcript
Q: What triggered an evaluation of 3PL providers, including ShipBob, recently?
Nick Codispoti: We have 60 clinics nationwide and we basically send new patients a package. Right now it's primarily more print shop related, but there was a question to see if we wanted to add more product with it, like we take care of veins. So right now it's like a brochure and a letter and an appointment card, but maybe we wanted to add like a compression stocking or something. So I'm a longtime friend of Anthony Watson, one of the founders, and so he put me in touch based on their volume, that maybe ShipBob could be a solution here.
Q: What were your evaluation criteria for deciding whether a 3PL would work for you?
Nick Codispoti: Right now our current staff is like their side job or labor. We spent labor hours like packaging this all up. And we had a print shop, obviously design and print. So I was just. This is the first time I was looking to see, to kind of get this out of house and automate it. And so that was the initial sort of request and evaluation.
Q: Did you have specific requirements around speed, cost, or quality?
Nick Codispoti: I evaluated the cost that was costing me, like in house of how many FTEs and then also like the collateral. So that was initially going to be the price point. First off, point one, I was thinking, because I can automate it, it would be cheaper. Point two is if I got this task off the team, it would be a big win. They don't want to do it. And then three, just like scalability as we add 20, 30 more clinics instead of sort of training other people to do it or not. This is completely out of their scope. So there was three reasons why I engaged there.
Q: Did you evaluate any other providers besides ShipBob?
Nick Codispoti: We ended up going to two to three more providers, but I think ShipBob was primarily like 3PL. We've now more entered into the print shop. So it's kind of like a different line of business. I don't think I continued with ShipBob's conversation because they weren't HIPAA compliant.
Q: Outside of the HIPAA compliance, how did you find the ShipBob offering in your sales conversations?
Nick Codispoti: I thought it was fair. I thought they were very creative in how they could. A little bit out of their scope or out of, it would have been more of a unique client experience. So there, I think, systems engineer, whoever came on the call, the sales was just overall very good experience. Just wasn't the right fit.
Q: Why is HIPAA compliance needed for your use case?
Nick Codispoti: It's like private personal data that was going to flow through and in the medical community. Needed to, we need to secure that with. I don't know exactly. I'm not so green on it, but there's an agreement between us and the vendor. How does the data pipeline to the vendor? What is the vendor doing to make sure that the privacy remains? So that's all HIPAA stuff. And I think ShipBob doesn't enter into the HIPAA world. At least they don't have initial clients in the medical world with that.
Q: Were there any other industry-specific needs you had to consider?
Nick Codispoti: Specific for industry specific. I wouldn't say industry specific. I think that was what I just mentioned was the industry specific response in terms of like practicality of our ask what was wrong with, why we moved from a 3PL to a print shop evaluated. So instead of adding the compression stockings, we continued with this print shop brochures and stuff. And so no longer was it a, you have version one on the shelf and you pick it up and you ship it out. It was more of like a blank piece of paper and everything's printed on there. So ShipBob was giving us a solution where they essentially just offload the current tasks off our team and now we've come up with a solution with a print shop that's more scalable because it's the uniqueness of the packages getting printed versus you're sorting everything.
Q: How does the print shop model work for your patient packages?
Nick Codispoti: So the current state of affairs is we have 50, 60 clinics, 35 physicians, obviously unique patient books, a new appointment. They have an appointment date and time as well. So what's happening is they get a letter specific to that clinic slash doctor, they get a written out appointment card, they get a brochure packed in and that's kind of the original package. And each of those letters are unique to each clinic or each doctor. And then obviously the appointment card of 5, 8, 5pm on certain date is unique. And so now and then also the envelopes were had the same return address as the clinic. So now you have a unique envelope. So now what we're doing is we're going to do a double window envelope, print the address on the back of the piece of paper. We're going to do if you've seen like these kind of like pull, those credit cards, those debit cards that kind of pull off on like a piece of paper. If you got like mail from like a loan agency or something, they have like, or like a fake, like a fake kind of. We're going to utilize that as an appointment card. We can just print on that. So now we're just printing on blank pieces of paper. And so when they get the data of Dr. A drew 9am they print directly. The software is now just generating what's going to be on the print. But you have a consistent envelope, white envelope, white piece of paper, appointment card.
Q: Can you share anything about your sales experience with ShipBob that they could learn from?
Nick Codispoti: I just think they met me where I was at. Which is like a warm introduction from the founder. Didn't oversell me, just came more as informative. I'm in like sales in the medical world and I just prefer like sort of that information that knowledge is really the most powerful sale. And so they had that approach. I really have no kind of critique or feedback from them. I thought they did sort of follow ups and organization of follow ups. Well brought in the solutions engineer at the appropriate time, were succinct on if they could do it or not. And when we came to a point where we just knew we were in a fit, they were good. They were the ones not pushing more. It was like, okay, we tried. We're not the fit right now.
Q: Did they reference any similar clients or was this truly unique for them?
Nick Codispoti: I couldn't remember a name. I don't think they referenced a specific client, but I thought they were. I didn't know how they would do it because I knew 3PL but they reviewed with me many times of how they could sort of pre or pre receive, make these things unique and then potentially like write appointment cards. So I thought their solutions were creative. Even though like they didn't just give up the moment they heard anything, they continued to follow up and try to be creative. So that's where I'm like, I was impressed by that, that process.
Q: If you were to expand your shipping at some point to include physical goods, would you consider ShipBob again?
Nick Codispoti: We'd have to. Because now we're dealing not with a print shop. We're dealing with just packaging.
Q: You had a positive enough interaction that they would be a vendor you'd consider for that?
Nick Codispoti: Definitely.
Q: Is there anything else you think would be worth sharing for them to improve?
Nick Codispoti: I just think overall it was a square peg in a round hole. We tried. They were professional and I was impressed by them and it was just not the fit at the moment.

IVW-00212,ShipBob,Rob Capodici,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Megan O'Leary, Head of Merchandising & Logistics at ShineOn
Company Snapshot ShineOn is a small print-on-demand jewelry and gift manufacturer headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, providing custom-engraved jewelry, accessories, and personalized gifts for e-commerce merchants across North America and Europe, specializing in in-house production and rapid fulfillment.
Primer Megan rejected ShipBob's pricing after evaluating them to outsource non-personalized products from their 15,000 square foot facility.
Perspective ShipBob's rates exceeded competitors and included margin built into shipping costs. Megan needed to maintain ShineOn's own shipping accounts to preserve volume discounts critical for their production items. The pricing structure would have eliminated profitability for the pick-and-pack portion of their business they sought to outsource. Additionally, ShipBob missed their initial pricing deadline and later offered standard negotiation tactics when Megan declined—approaches she views as time-wasting rather than partnership-building.
Pulse • Embedded shipping margins — ShipBob built profit into shipping rates → eliminated deal profitability compared to competitors • Own shipping account requirement — maintaining volume discounts essential for production items → ShipBob's model incompatible with needs • Inventory management gap — competitors offered automated reorder recommendations → ShineOn chose to keep operations in-house

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: What motivated you to evaluate new 3PL vendors in the first place? And where were you coming from?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, so we've really grown our company over these past few years and the production part of our company has grown pretty dramatically. And so I started. But a big piece of our business is the pick pieces, things that don't need to be personalized, going to the end customer, being a POD company, things that, our bread and butter, keep the lights on but don't need as handheld as going through the machines, being engraved, being printed on and and so forth. So what we were looking for was a partner that could take this pick part of the business. The more like easy part of the business for us so we could really focus in on our, our warehouse space and our capacity for the production and really growing that side of the business that's been taking off with our. The, the B2B side and is really a much more profitable piece of the business as well.
Drew Giovannoli: And you were managing your own warehouse?
Megan O'Leary: We do, yeah. We have a warehouse. We have a 15,000 square foot warehouse down in Lutz, Florida. We just moved to it. Well, we're just moving to another one instead of.
Drew Giovannoli: How did you go about finding vendors and what was your short list after that?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, so we have looked at 3PL companies for a while for different reasons around the company over the past few years. So I've interviewed quite a few. And so from that as I set up more in person interviews to understand the cost, the scope, understand who might be a good fit for what we were looking for. That's how I talked to a couple different companies and went through the interview process. But I would say it wasn't necessarily like a one time interview. I've done it multiple times over the past few years. So I was kind of able to figure out who I want to go with. I went with to interview ShipBob because of their. How expansive they are and they have a lot of warehouse points in a lot of key areas. So the time to get to the customer would be short and being able to support eventually multiple warehouses. But we are really looking to start with one warehouse. And the reason for that was because of inventory control. Being able to make sure we had the inventory position in the correct places. Minimize the complexities around inventory purchases and making sure things are sent to the right locations.
Drew Giovannoli: What was your evaluation criteria as you decided should we go with 3PL?
Megan O'Leary: I had like 26 different questions, maybe more than that that I asked each 3PL company. But some, some of them were obviously pricing was a massive driver needed to see if it was going to make financial sense for us. Being able to use our own shipping accounts was a huge perk by being able to continue to grow our own shipping accounts. Otherwise if we were to take that piece off of our shipping accounts it can dramatically change our shipping rates that we're getting for our production items. So being able to maintain our own shipping account so we maintain our status more or less like with these shipping companies and being able to see, the SLAs were important, the receiving fees, how things are being received in the inventory, timing and frequency, the. The time, the estimated time in transit to those different areas and being able to receive products in. So if we're boating products in how close they were to the port or what the time was, what the process was to get it to them if they would be able to take possession at port and get it to their warehouses or. We still had to coordinate that. So yeah, I had a long list of a bunch of different topics to go over when vetting the companies.
Drew Giovannoli: Was there anything about your industry that you are looking for industry expertise in as you went to the 3PLs?
Megan O'Leary: No, not necessarily.
Drew Giovannoli: Who made it to the starting line of your evaluation?
Megan O'Leary: I evaluated over time because our needs had changed throughout years of what we were looking for. We were also sitting on the precipice of our lease expiring at our current facility. And so looking at the facilities and seeing like, okay, do we want to. Do we need to grow and just say, like, yes, we're going to bring this in house? Or are we going to be able to maintain the same size or downsize our facility by outsourcing some of this? So we were sitting right on that. That precipice, which is where these conversations were happening fairly quickly. So some of the rates I would say were like. When I received them from ShipBob, that was the biggest driver for me was we got the rates. I took a look at what it was going to look like and I was like, this is going to be a lot more expensive than what we're paying for right now, which is going to take kind of to. My margin is actually just not going to end up being profitable for us if we were to that way. So that was the driver for me with not going forward with ShipBob. Ultimately we decided to just go ahead and keep it in house. But I will say that the rates with ShipBob were more expensive than competitors rates that we received. And it was a lot of like, they baked their margin into shipping costs. And so it didn't make sense for us to move forward with them as they wanted to use their shipping accounts, which in turn made it so we would have paid more in shipping for our items. And it just wouldn't have. It just wouldn't have worked out for us.
Drew Giovannoli: Beyond the price, is there anything you can share about how easy or difficult it was or how long it took to get pricing?
Megan O'Leary: We pulled our information out of ShipStation, they gave us the criteria they needed. We passed that over. I will say that like the timeline, the deadlines that were provided to me by our account rep were missed. And so it took a little bit longer than we were hoping in order to get the pricing sent back over to us. But he did end up doing it like it was in an off hour. I want to say it was like in the middle and I was like 8, 9pm something like that. And he ended up passing him over to me. So I was able to take a look at it over a weekend, but it wasn't in the original identified time frame if I remember correctly. So it took a little bit longer than we were hoping for. And then after I let them know that like, hey, this pricing didn't work. My biggest frustration with companies is when they say like, oh well, let me know it didn't work and I'll go back to my team and see what we can do normal. And it's like now, like we're good. I don't have time for like the back and forth and to kind of try and make it work for you all. And that's not necessarily just ShipBob. It's, it's a strategy companies use. Right. Like they put it out there, we say no and then they kind of say like, okay, well let's go back and work on it. But at that point for me it's kind of like opportunities are gone because I'm not going to keep coming back if it didn't work the first time. I've already done the analysis. I'm not going to kind of keep digging into it in order to try to force what is a square peg in a round hole. So I'd say it was, it was fine. It just, I didn't want to have the back and forth to see if it was going to end up working.
Drew Giovannoli: If pricing matched your pricing and it was set up in a way where you kept your own rates, were the benefits of ShipBob strong enough to have made a switch?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, yeah, I would have made the switch.
Drew Giovannoli: What are the top strengths that would have made you make the switch even if pricing was on par with what you're paying today?
Megan O'Leary: In order, like the benefits? Is that what you're asking? Like, what would the benefits have been? So the benefits would have been we would have been able to reduce our warehouse size, which in turn would have saved us some money in order to not have to have as big as a facility. We would have been able to be more hands off as far as the. The day today, the assembly of the products. We would have been able to shift our internal focus on just, hey, let's make sure the buys are coming through, let's make sure inventory is correct. And then we would just be able to focus a lot more on production and growing that side of the business and allowing the piece that operates pretty autonomously to just continue to operate fairly autonomously. So the benefits would have been able to not be as distracted, I would say, especially as you go into key holiday time frames. But the big, we offer a lot of perks with like two day shipping, overnight shipping, full economy shipping, and so those add additional selling days. So making sure that all that criteria is met and we're using our shipping accounts is. Is a big, important piece of it.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that made ShipBob stand out in a positive or negative light compared to competitors?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah. So one thing that another competitor was offering was help with the inventory management. So as items like they would help make recommendations or let us know when things were getting low by evaluating the days of supply they had and how that product was turning out in order to send us a recommendation, hey, you're starting to get low in this warehouse. You need to place another order. Here's how much we recommend ordering based off of how this product is selling out of this warehouse. That takes a lot of the analysis and guesswork off of my end. So that was something that stood out to me. With another competitor, it's like even less work that we have to do because the issue with having things across multiple warehouses is you have to maintain inventory in those warehouses and they all sell differently. So it adds complexity. So I think that it's. That's an additional perk that could be offered by ShipBob.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve a company like yours?
Megan O'Leary: I mean the vendor management piece is a big one. Right. Like being able to give a 3PL the opportunity in order to just operate pretty autonomously. Hey, I'll give you contacts to my vendors and you can just kind of kick the PO over to me to approve when you pass it out. When you're running low on inventory and need to place another supply, we can give you the lead. Times like being able to manage the inventory and send us recommendations on purchases would be a huge one. Just to be able to take that additional load off and they do their own analysis.
Drew Giovannoli: Is that something that you've seen at all?
Megan O'Leary: I've seen it through like inventory management companies inventory management system. So it's absolutely out there. Being able to have that be a part of the inventory process and. And that's being offered through 3PL would wildly incentivized like a change because then it's even more hands off and you don't have to worry about it. And it just kind of operates on its own and a PO could just be kicked over. And I say, yep, that actually looks good. We have. That's an approved PO. Go ahead and just send it over to my vendor. So that way it's. It's even more hands off and you're just kind of in the monitor stance. That would be a huge benefit. Huge, huge benefit. So that would probably be my biggest recommendation to a 3PL company. Would just be just kind of the soup to nuts management.
Drew Giovannoli: Any feedback on the sales engagement, the pitch and the demo?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, there really wasn't a demo. I would say it was more of an intro call where we were talking about what I was looking for and then what they would be able to offer. So there was. There was a lot of conversation around who we are, what we're doing, what I'm looking for, the scale in which we were looking to. To do and then what ShipBob really was in the network. I would say there was a lot of conversation around. I wanted to start with one warehouse and he was asking why and would I consider going to multiple warehouses. And it really came down to the inventory management as to why I wouldn't want to do that. Which is again where that other piece could kind of come in handy saying like, okay, we'll manage the inventory for you and we'll move them around through the warehouses as need be. So. So yeah, I think that there really wasn't as much as a demo. Is that part of it? But it wasn't pushy. I would say very informative for them to understand a lot more about. And then I. I was able to. To ask the questions and understand a bit more about ShipBob and what makes them different in their eyes. But yeah. Does that answer your question?

Kroma Matt Lebo (00:04:44 - 00:04:44) Hello. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Hi, how are you? Matt Lebo (00:04:49 - 00:04:50) I'm doing all right. Matt Lebo (00:04:50 - 00:04:51) How are you? Matt Lebo (00:04:51 - 00:04:51) Good. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Thanks for making time. Appreciate it. For context, this is a interview for Ship Bob, private to them only. And their goal is to simply learn how they can improve. I'm a third party, so I have no bias in the matter. But I appreciate the chance to get to know you and learn more about your experiences. And with your permission, we'll record this. It'll be a 20 minute conversation and privately use only for ship up. And you'll get an email of compensation should within 24 hours banks around July 4th. I don't know exactly what's going to happen there. So may push into Monday of next week. Matt Lebo (00:05:28 - 00:05:29) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Does that all work for you? Matt Lebo (00:05:31 - 00:05:33) Yes. Okay, great. Matt Lebo (00:05:36 - 00:05:39) How widely circulated is this video? I don't know that I filmed 100%. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Only internally at Ship up. Matt Lebo (00:05:44 - 00:05:44) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** But it may be like it gets shared through the product or marketing, sales, any, anywhere they feel like it can be improved. The way it works is I take this. We have probably aggregate 30 interviews together to produce a report, but they will have access to the original kind of transcripts and videos. My goal is to put together themes from a bunch of conversations. Matt Lebo (00:06:04 - 00:06:04) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:06:06 - 00:06:09) Yeah. Great. Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I was just checking out Chroma Wellness. Would you mind kind of introducing yourself and your role kind of responsibilities there? Matt Lebo (00:06:16 - 00:06:16) Yep. Matt Lebo (00:06:16 - 00:06:22) My name is Matt Lebow, Director of Operations, deal with sourcing logistics. Matt Lebo (00:06:24 - 00:06:25) Awesome. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And did you recently evaluate and decide not to go with Shipop, is that correct? Matt Lebo (00:06:33 - 00:06:33) Right. Matt Lebo (00:06:33 - 00:06:34) Awesome. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** What prompted you to evaluate new solutions in the first place? Matt Lebo (00:06:42 - 00:06:52) It's the biggest challenge. We were having challenges around inventory. In addition, we thought that, you know, Bison was not the best. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Where were you before? Matt Lebo (00:06:57 - 00:06:59) I'd rather not say. Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And as you ran into those challenges, what criteria did you have as you began to evaluate other providers? Matt Lebo (00:07:13 - 00:07:30) I think it's, you know, pricing is a huge thing, but also, you know, we have a complex product so ability to, you know. Matt Lebo (00:07:32 - 00:07:33) You know. Matt Lebo (00:07:35 - 00:08:28) You know, complete the complex operations of the assembly and you know, a feeling of, you know, having good communication because there's just a lot of things that come up. And so, you know, knowing that there's someone to call and get a hold of software, I think that's something that we're dealing with, you know, that is currently not great in our existing solution. And so, you know, knowing that there's some, you know, usable wms that's going to, you know, simplify my role or at least not further complicated, I guess. Yeah. So I think you. But generally, you know, I Think boiling it down price customer service software. Matt Lebo (00:08:30 - 00:08:30) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I mean what I also heard is you, you've got food products and so I imagine like what I heard was that it matters to you that that person knows how to handle that complexity. Right. I was looking at the bone broth. Looked like there's all sorts of things in there from Matcha to cookie butter. I didn't go too deep yet, but like there's diverse food products that. That matter to you or was kind of. Matt Lebo (00:08:54 - 00:09:11) It's not, it's not about that. It's about the. We have a kit. There's an assembly for that kit. It's a complex assembly. It can't, you know, there's a number of components. If there's a team that's not versed in that, then things can get mixed up very quick. Right? Matt Lebo (00:09:11 - 00:09:12) Yep. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So it's more about the complexity of the kit than industry specific experience around food. Matt Lebo (00:09:17 - 00:09:18) Right. Cool. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I'm gonna launch something on your screen. Really simple. Just we try to get a little quantitative data answer like a brief survey, if you're okay with it and don't mind. It's just. It's not about ship, Bob. It's about. As you looked at vendors, how important were these things to you? Ship up or any other vendor you might have looked at. Awesome. Thank you so much. Mentioned the complexity and the price. How well suited from 0 to 10 was ship off at those things. Where did they. Matt Lebo (00:10:15 - 00:10:15) And then. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And where do they fall short? Matt Lebo (00:10:19 - 00:10:34) I would say they were fairly well suited to really all of the things we required. I don't know that it's anywhere they necessarily fell short. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:10:35 - 00:10:57) I think that a large driving factor of our decision was a personal relationship. Not mine, but someone else in the business with another three PL and the things with. The thing with three PLs is it's. It's a rough world. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:10:57 - 00:11:09) And so know, you know, having done business with, you know, if someone has done business with someone for years upon years and they feel very comfortable with them, it's very hard to overcome that. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:11:10 - 00:11:17) With you know, even though. Even though the calls I had were good. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:11:18 - 00:11:33) So I guess the thing is that person that came on was new. So when I started the conversations with ship up, that wasn't a factor. And then it became a factor. So I would say that's really the biggest driving force of why we didn't. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Now. Matt Lebo (00:11:35 - 00:11:36) I think. Matt Lebo (00:11:37 - 00:11:38) The. Matt Lebo (00:11:40 - 00:12:34) And I guess it was one of these things where it would be virtually impossible for me to sell ship Bob or anyone else into that situation. And and, but I guess if we wanted to take it one level further, let's say that relationship didn't exist, would we have gone with Ship Bob? I think they were in the running. I would say the things that I was not fully comfortable with it at, you know, at this point of my. At this point in the search was, you know, shipo's larger than. It's. It's larger than a lot of the other places we were looking at. Most of the other companies had three, four DCs. You know, ship Bob has a bit more than that. And I know that. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Or I. Matt Lebo (00:12:38 - 00:12:42) You know, my belief is that kind of. That complicates things. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:12:42 - 00:14:54) It's a lot to oversee. It's a lot to make sure that every team on the ground is sharp right there. It's. It's like fulfillment's not complicated, but it's also very complicated. And, you know, I've seen. Not from Ship Bob, but I've seen where it gets sloppy and how things kind of go sideways. And so I would say just the skate, you know, the scale of Ship Bob was almost so, you know, it was something that I wasn't fully 100 comfortable with. And I think the thing is, if I was selling soap and it's like, you know, there's four varieties of soap. Yeah. It doesn't. I'm not. It would be much less of a thing. But when you have 40. Well, call it 55 components that go into a single box. You can't ship a single box if all 55 of those are not there. They're not, you know, organized. You know, then you. There's just a lot more holes to fall through, I think, with. With that kind of reach. So that was, you know, that was my biggest thing, I think, you know, I. I would say, in terms of my general view of Ship Bob, if you would, you know, I would have not even had a conversation with them probably three or four years ago, because I think the reputation was that there was a lot of growth very quickly. It. And it was not fully digested. And, you know, there was that. The chaos of COVID Right. You know, D2C was going crazy and Shabbat was growing. And, you know, I think there was an industry vibe that, you know, if you were a small, medium brand, you were like you were going to fall through the cracks at something like Shipbob. You know, I think then I think that reputation has improved, but I still think it's, you know, there's probably some hurdle there. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** What did. What changed your mind? Or at least slightly improved it. Was it just talking to other people in charge of fulfillment? Was it an event newsletter? Like, how did they improve it? And you know, my goal is to figure out, yeah, how, how, and then how do they keep doing it? Matt Lebo (00:15:12 - 00:15:13) But what. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Any ideas changed it? Matt Lebo (00:15:18 - 00:15:24) I mean, I would say maybe some conversations, but it was, it was more conversations with the team. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:15:24 - 00:15:36) It was saying, okay, I'll hop on the phone, let's see what this is about. And then saying, okay, you know what, this actually seems like a decent team. And the more people I spoke with, you know, I gained some level of confidence. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So did any of the smaller companies that you looked at do something that gave you this increased sense of trust that they could handle 50 different elements going into a box? I think, Chip, I would be interested to learn, like, what about their process as a small company? Or is it just reputationally smaller company, smaller team, you can get kind of a different level of service. What about the smaller company gave you that? Was it something they did or just overall thoughts? Matt Lebo (00:16:10 - 00:16:19) No, I, I would say it's more my, I guess my existing experience. Matt Lebo (00:16:20 - 00:16:21) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:16:21 - 00:16:57) And that, you know, spreading out fulfillment and especially the assembly part across multiple DCs, I saw how that just get got, you know, incredibly not, I wouldn't say an order order of magnitude, but meaningfully more complex spreading out. And so it was, you know, I think there was almost just a feeling of simplicity. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:16:58 - 00:17:10) With some of those smaller things. And I think the other thing is some of the, you know, a lot, some of those smaller companies, you know, the founders or, you know, you know, people that started the business are still there. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:17:11 - 00:17:25) They're sitting in the office taking the calls with you, and you can. You, you just have a feeling that, like, if something goes sideways, which it will, like I can get one of these guys on the phone and, and, and figure it out. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, right. Matt Lebo (00:17:27 - 00:17:39) Whereas, you know, you get a feeling with a larger company that's like, it'll get figured out, but not, you know, it might. There might be a queue of things that need to happen first. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:17:40 - 00:17:40) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:17:40 - 00:18:00) And I believe, you know, I just, I guess I generally feel that with smaller companies there is kind of like a dynamic, more of a dynamic or, you know, quick response that can be had. Matt Lebo (00:18:00 - 00:18:01) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:18:01 - 00:18:02) Because of that. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, I understand that. Just for Ship, Bob's learning, if it got towards the end of the deal and you're kind of feeling that way and the founder, CEO Dhruv, or his co founder hopped on a call with you from shipbob, would that have helped overcome it, do you think? Or like. Matt Lebo (00:18:22 - 00:18:31) Well, yeah, I mean, we're delving into a bit of hypothetical at that. Because when we made our, when, when the decision was made, it was not because of what I'm. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:18:32 - 00:18:44) And so we're saying, well, like if we got to that point, would it have made a difference? You know, probably. Probably. Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:18:44 - 00:18:45) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:18:45 - 00:19:06) I, I think, I think that maybe not even getting on the phone with a co founder, but maybe just knowing that someone who could make things happen there was some sort of personal kind of touch. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right? Matt Lebo (00:19:07 - 00:19:08) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And just for your kind, like the hypotheticals, just. So if there, if it comes up as a theme, right. That there are people trusting smaller companies because of that access, hearing what might work as solutions, giving them things to test could be useful. That's, you know, that's why I ask. Matt Lebo (00:19:26 - 00:19:41) Yeah, I think could be worth, worth a test, I think. You know, and I, I think. And the other thing is it may not matter as much to every business. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:19:45 - 00:19:50) You know, I think with ours in particular, there's just an element of chaos. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:19:51 - 00:20:01) Because of, you know, you've got a product that's a meaningful money in revenue that you can't ship if you don't have 55 things in the same place. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right? Matt Lebo (00:20:02 - 00:20:03) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:20:04 - 00:20:46) So there just needs to be like a really hands on kind of thing where it's like, you know, there's, there's just a lot, there's a lot of like inside baseball stuff where the, it's like, you know, oh, you know, you've got, here's, here's your, your 55 things and you've got X number of each one of these. Oh, but wait, did you get short like one of these boxes? Mislabeled and it's actually like a, the wrong color for that particular thing. And so you don't, you know, but you wouldn't know that unless you're, you've been working on that box for a long time or you, you know, you're the guy who's. I'm babbling a bit, but you know, I get it. Matt Lebo (00:20:47 - 00:20:48) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** It's a cool product. My wife and I on a more recent health kick and I think she would, she would love it. I'm really excited to try this out. You don't have to share names, you're not comfortable. But where did Shipbob stand out positively or negatively against the other vendors you explored and don't have to include kind of the person who came in and had a preference, but wherever you could share kind of their competitive differences, positive and negative. I appreciate it. Matt Lebo (00:21:27 - 00:21:30) I would say pricing was like, it was fair. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:21:30 - 00:21:45) It was mid, you know, it was better than what we currently have. And in terms of the, you know, the companies we were in looking at it was, you know, there's, there's a couple different things that go into pricing. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:21:45 - 00:21:49) You've got storage, pick and peg and assembly for us at least. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:21:49 - 00:22:05) So there's those three components. So you know, they were really good on in some aspects. They were middle of the road on some others. I, I would say that pricing was not, you know, something that deterred, that would have deterred us. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:22:14 - 00:22:17) Wms, I thought was, was pretty, pretty good. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Now were you looking at it for WMS because you're using a different, you're not doing warehousing yourself. Unless I cut that wrong. Matt Lebo (00:22:29 - 00:22:35) Correct. But I'm talking about the platform, the thing that we would be using. Like there's interactive software tool. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:22:35 - 00:22:53) Like where are my orders, what's my inventory? All that. I'm talking about that I thought it was, that was a good tool. And then I guess personal relationship was, you know, it was fine. But it did kind of change a few times. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:22:53 - 00:23:08) So like, and maybe this is because we were taking forever to do something and so it kind of just got passed down the road. But you know, I would say that's some, you know, the people I, I, everyone I spoke with was great. Matt Lebo (00:23:09 - 00:23:09) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:23:09 - 00:23:11) But it did kind of change a few times. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So. Matt Lebo (00:23:11 - 00:23:16) Sure that I think, you know. Matt Lebo (00:23:16 - 00:23:16) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Is there anything that any of the other vendors did that was a impressive standout? So not necessarily a ship up weakness, but something you're like, oh, wow, that, that was stand out for me. Matt Lebo (00:23:34 - 00:23:34) You. Matt Lebo (00:23:34 - 00:23:50) Know, I think not really, to be honest with you. I mean, not really. Matt Lebo (00:23:50 - 00:23:50) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** You mentioned pricing. Something we're just trying to dig into a little bit. Is, did the, was there any. How easy or difficult was it to gather and provide the data needed for pricing? Like, what was that process? Like? It sounds like the pricing seemed fair, but was there anything negative, neutral or positive about that experience? Matt Lebo (00:24:10 - 00:24:25) No, I thought it was pretty straightforward, to be honest. You know, it's a, it's a pain because you got to pull a bunch of different information, but yeah, you kind of have to do that forever. You know, I did it, I've done it four times. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:24:26 - 00:24:34) So like it's just part of the process, you know. Yeah, it, I wouldn't say it was any worse than any, you know. Matt Lebo (00:24:35 - 00:24:35) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:24:36 - 00:25:11) Any other process. And I would say that it's, it's probably gotten simpler right to do over the, over the years because you know, the information is a lot easier to, to gather. And so it's. I it. At one point in time it was almost like a, you know, you'd be pretty motivated to, to look around. I think that now it's, it's a lot easier to, to look around, have some conversations than it was in the past. Matt Lebo (00:25:11 - 00:25:12) Cool. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Just a couple more for you, just to confirm. It sounds like somebody came in, they had a preferred vendor. You did make a switch from somebody to somebody else or do you end up sticking with your current provider? Matt Lebo (00:25:27 - 00:25:30) There's some, I'll just say no comment. Matt Lebo (00:25:31 - 00:25:31) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** If you were in charge of SHIP up, how would you, what would be the top priorities you would do to better serve a company like, like yours, like Chroma Wellness? Matt Lebo (00:25:50 - 00:26:21) Well, I don't know that I would say just broader general in industry wise. I would probably try to, you know, let's just say I wanted to attack the CPG space. For instance. I would get some people out at some events and events where like the operations people are, you know, geo specifics. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** You give me, maybe some of you attend. Matt Lebo (00:26:24 - 00:27:53) So you know, I, we are, you know, a fairly lean team. So I, you know, my, I do a lot of sourcing of ingredients and that kind of stuff as well. But like IFT or supply side, you know, there's a lot of different ops professionals there get, you know, just going, you know, getting some cocktails with people and like, you know, but because I, you know, there is still, you know, as much as we talk about technology and all that stuff, there is something where, you know, you want to do business with people, you know, and that you trust, you know, you trust and you know, price can only be so much of a differentiator. And so I think that, you know, and, and, and I have, you know, my belief, I think I'm kind of past it. But I do believe there is a bit of a, a stigma with ship, Bob, you know, in amongst certain people. And so I think finding what, you know, making that personal relationship with people, you know, showing up to things, you know, once and then getting a, get, you know, getting some people to, you know, some notable people to, to work with you and then be able to kind of say, okay, well it worked for them like, you know. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So how did you, you knew about ship, but how did you come to include them in evaluation in the first place given that reputation? Matt Lebo (00:28:06 - 00:28:29) Was it a. I think that they had reached out When I had started, you know, I was already, like, in the midst of the process, and I was like, you know, what's one more? You know, And I think that I probably, you know, wasn't that interested. And then I had a really good conversation, and so it was like, okay, let's. Let's at least see what they have to say. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Okay, last question. Which Chroma product would you most recommend? I think the broths are probably the most likely thing that we'd try. Matt Lebo (00:28:41 - 00:28:41) Any. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Any will be the one you should check. Matt Lebo (00:28:44 - 00:29:09) My wife and I should check out, let's say Matcha. Matcha or Broths are probably the two biggest sellers. The hydration does really well in the summer. The magnesium is. Is also a fairly steady, good product. Those are the four that I'm. I order for myself, you know, fairly regularly. Matt Lebo (00:29:09 - 00:29:11) Great. Thanks, man. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I appreciate your time today. I hope you have a great long weekend. Matt Lebo (00:29:15 - 00:29:22) Yeah, you as well. And if you want to drop me an email, I'll get you a discount code or something. Matt Lebo (00:29:23 - 00:29:23) Thanks. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, I'd love that. I'll definitely check it out. And like I mentioned, you'll get compensated for this time. I don't know with the holiday, how the bank kind of pays out and stuff, but by Monday, you should have at least a note with some details. Matt Lebo (00:29:35 - 00:29:35) Okay. Matt Lebo (00:29:36 - 00:29:36) It works. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Thanks, man. Matt Lebo (00:29:37 - 00:29:38) All right, take care. Matt Lebo (00:29:38 - 00:29:39) Bye.

IVW-00218,ShipBob,Brian Thomas,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Brian Thomas, CEO at Completing the Puzzle
Company Snapshot Completing the Puzzle is a small consumer subscription service headquartered in Dallas, providing puzzle rental and delivery of high-quality jigsaw puzzles to consumers across the United States, specializing in eco-friendly, reusable packaging and a sustainable, circular rental model.
Primer Brian endured a six-month evaluation process with ShipBob only to receive pricing that violated his core transparency requirements.
Perspective Brian's evaluation lasted from January 8th to June 11th with no meaningful communication after April 23rd. His primary criterion was pricing transparency—pass-through rates with clear subscription fees rather than markup on shipping costs. After explicitly stating this requirement multiple times, ShipBob ultimately proposed the exact pricing structure he had rejected. The experience felt ""misleading"" and ""slimy"" when sales reps consistently justified rate markups by saying ""we have to make money""—identical responses that suggested scripted objections rather than genuine partnership discussions.
Pulse • Six-month timeline — evaluation from January to June with two-month silence → deal rejection and damaged relationship • Pricing transparency mandate — explicit request for pass-through rates → ShipBob proposed marked-up structure anyway
 • Scripted sales responses — three different reps used identical justifications for rate markups → undermined trust and partnership potential

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: What was your current solution at the time—your own warehouse, managing yourself?
Brian Thomas: Own warehouse, own software, own negotiated rates.
Drew Giovannoli: What prompted you to consider options outside of that?
Brian Thomas: We're at the point where I either need to open up other warehouses or find someone that has a 3PL network that I can like rent little spaces from to take advantage of like economies of scale shipping so we have enough volume where it start. It's making sense. It doesn't make sense for me to open up my own little warehouses, but it does make sense to rent little spaces cost efficient. And so it was like two parts that I was looking for was one was that. And the other thing was I spend a large majority of my time negotiating shipping rates and keeping the vendor relationships positive. It's a struggle. It's not actually something that I, I enjoy some of it and I enjoy the people, but it's also like it's a little taxing sometimes.
Drew Giovannoli: It's not why you started the business.
Brian Thomas: 100% exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually, that's probably the more fair description of it. Like, I don't know, I get wined and dined to places. Like I went to a UFC event. Like, I don't know. It's like, what's. If you're a UFC fan, it's like, that's part of the canvas. Yeah. It's front row seat. Row one. It was cool. Who took you EasyPost. Yeah. And so if you're a UFC fan, Uriah Faber sat behind me. So that was like dope. Yeah, it was like that made my experience, but it also opened my eyes where it's like, there's a lot of money in this, so maybe if I can get someone that's not going to take me front row and give me a little bit better rates. Let's see. And yeah, so I was looking for someone to take all that off because as cool as that is, like, it's not really what I started it for.
Drew Giovannoli: How did you source vendors and what was your evaluation criteria?
Brian Thomas: How did I source them? Going to events. Events. Google. Asking friends. So I'm in a mastermind with 24. There's 25 of us in this mastermind. I ask them, go to events like Sub Summit, Shop Talk and like Pack Expo. All the packing stuff. And then googling and just seeing like competitive analysis. Just like ShipHero versus. And then ShipBob's gonna come up. Yeah, ShipHero. ShipEasy versus. And it'll pop up with ShipBob or something like that. And I'm tangentially friends with like a C suite or a founder of ShipBob. I forget who and who the friend is. But that was, I think that was. I think that person's in the mastermind. And that was the original, like intro.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you have a set of criteria going in?
Brian Thomas: Yeah, like the, the main thing was it was if you're going to charge a subscription fee and fees on top, do that. And don't charge me on rates or charge me on rates. I don't want. I don't want this double dipping because then I'm just going to. I'm going to feel taken advantage of and I just, I'd rather just have it be super transparent and I'd rather just get your pass through rates and then you just charge me what you want to make. Just so I can feel like we're actually having a partner and relationship versus like me always second guessing, like, are they overcharging me? What's going on here? Was number one.
Drew Giovannoli: What would be the other criteria?
Brian Thomas: I think that's, that's number one. And the rest came down to like, did I like them? Was it efficient? Like did they. Were they going to have as little errors as possible? So when I think about shipping, I think there, there are three legs. Price, speed, and quality for returns. I don't care about speed because I can always float the inventory. So I want it to be low price and high quality. And if it's super, super slow, great. Like that's like the ideal scenario.
Drew Giovannoli: Were there specific needs or use case or industry requirements you were looking for?
Brian Thomas: Nope.
Drew Giovannoli: What vendors did you look at?
Brian Thomas: Some I don't want to share the ones I will share Worldwide Express and then the rest are just kind of one offs to be honest. Like regional 3PLs. So piecing together this like the puzzle of return shipping. So using different regional people to like someone to handle LA, someone to handle Atlanta, someone to handle Chicago and then Pennsylvania ish area.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you end up choosing another vendor in the process?
Brian Thomas: There's actually one, a competitor to ShipBob that is gonna do. Honestly gonna do everything I wanted ShipBob to do. They're passing through the rates. They're. We have like a per label markup and then we have a flat subscription fee and they're passing through the rates 100%. And they were actually like super transparent. They're like, these are the rates. And I was like, yeah, I know. Like, I can like, they, they sent me more than enough and I, I've now talked to enough vendors where I know that they're. They're not marking it up. So yeah, great.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you think the biggest gap that ShipBob failed to meet your expectations or weaknesses or reasons why you didn't go with them?
Brian Thomas: It's honestly the people, because the. I've talked to ShipBob two or three times now, and I kind of have the exact same conversation that I have with everyone where I'm like, don't upcharge me on the rates. Just charge me like your. I want to know what your margin is. Because I want to have a relationship and a partnership and that's what I view it is. And if you don't want to, that's fine, but if you want to, we can keep going down the road. And they're like, okay. And then ShipBob is the slowest to get back to me. And at the end they end up marking up the rates and charging a subscription fee. And I'm like, you're just wasting my time. And it's just. It was frustrating. So it's just the people, like I say like, hey, don't, don't touch the red button. And then they're like, we won't. And then two months later they just like press the button and you're just like, oh, this is just disappointing from a humanity moral standpoint, to be honest.
Drew Giovannoli: How long did it take you to receive pricing from ShipBob?
Brian Thomas: They're like probably the longest. April 23rd to July 11th. And just to get a no. No, no. And so the whole. This most recent conversation started early February. So it took February until June 11th. Let's see the earliest. Oh, man. Yeah, I, I can't off the top of my head find or just in this moment find the first conversation, but the earliest email that I can see. Oh, January. Nope. Oh, it is January 8th. So we talked from January 8th. Gathered data, went back and forth until April 23rd. Yeah, April 23rd. And then from April 23rd I just sat waiting. And then June 11th I got a rejection that they weren't going to be able to do it a long time. That's six months. It's crazy.
Drew Giovannoli: How long did the competitors take?
Brian Thomas: The longest one is they just actually sent it today. Three weeks. He just sent it today. So I will, I can pull it up. June 4th to July 3rd, that was the longest. So 29 days. Correct. Yeah. The normal turnaround time is like two and a half, three weeks. The only land actually will give the people that just responded today a pass because in the middle of it there was a most recently rate increase. So it caused like some back and forth. They were, they communicated that. So the expectation was that like it didn't go the 29 days without communication like with ShipBob with these guys, they preemptively reached out and said like, hey, as you know, industry changes and we're. It's taking a little longer. With ShipBob, it was just nothing.
Drew Giovannoli: What was the experience like from January to April in terms of pricing and sales?
Brian Thomas: At the time it was fine and it was actually seemed really productive. And then at the end it just seemed misleading because it ended up being. It was disappointing in the end because it was overcharging on the rates, charges a subscription fee, which I asked not to do. And then when I pushed back, it was from whatever dates I told you, just silence. And then a rejection like, I don't know, it doesn't take that long to know that you don't want to do it.
Drew Giovannoli: If they had matched the pricing you needed in the format, would they have won the deal?
Brian Thomas: Yep. I think out of the gate. So I had a bad experience, a very similar experience like two years ago with them. Let's say all that experience is down, and it's just like starting fresh with ShipBob. It's called ShipBob 2. And it was the exact same software and everything probably. I mean, they were. Their. Their software and locations and everything else seemed awesome. It was just. It's honestly just people.
Drew Giovannoli: When you say people, was there a bad experience one to one with the person on the phone also?
Brian Thomas: Yeah, the first person. The I talked with the first person, like, organically, and then the next person I talked with at Sub Summit, and then this last person, they all said this exact same thing, which makes me feel like it's like a trained thing or learned when I push back on, why are you marking up the postage? They say, because we have to make money. All three of them said the exact same thing. And I was like, that's fine. But I started every conversation saying that I wanted you to be transparent with how much money you want to make. And they're just like, we're not telling you we have to make money. And it's just like it was the slimiest feeling.
Drew Giovannoli: Can you expand upon what you think they did well?
Brian Thomas: I think their tech's pretty interesting, the way that they digitized the warehouse. They would spend time understanding our layout, giving us guidance on the layout. The API looked pretty dope, honestly. Like, probably one of the better APIs that I've seen. Like, from a tech perspective, I was pretty excited to integrate with their software from a logistics perspective. I visited their warehouse in Dallas and it seemed pretty like, is a clean warehouse cleaner than this other one? I went today, and yeah, logistically and software wise, they seem to have it down.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve companies like yours?
Brian Thomas: Preemptively. Give, like, a timeline of, like, rough outline of, like, how long things should take. Because it was just a really long time without any notification and like, there was no expectation. Yeah, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that the other vendors did that ShipBob would benefit from hearing?
Brian Thomas: The. The tickets to the match, it was actually like, to me, it's actually a negative. Like, I'll do it all day long, but then I'm just like, oh, you're like, making more money. Like, a dinner is fine. Or like, honestly, the thing that does it for me is buying my employees, bringing coffee for the employees, coffee and donuts for the employees. I can do what I want. Like, I don't. If I wanted to go to the UFC, I could probably just pay for myself. Now it's cool if someone's paying for it, but what matters more to me is, like, the employees and them feeling like they get something. Yeah, the. The thing that the. The other vendors that I liked and the one that I'm going with, they were. They didn't waste time on the calls in a long, drawn out presentation. Like, I used to work for Booz Allen and it was like, very corporate, like, doing consulting, and we would do 20 page slideshows that were like, this is like, the benefits of working with Booz Allen and all this stuff. And I'm like, okay. Like, it doesn't really do much for me. And like, there was a lot of that with ShipBob, and I was just like, like, I get that ShipBob's proud of ShipBob, but ShipBob didn't seem proud to work with me. And all the other vendors, like, literally had like one or no slides about themselves and then jumped immediately into me. And it just didn't waste time either. So I had a call with the one today and we spent. It was a 30 minute call. We spent the last 15 minutes like talking about our dogs because they just got right to it versus ShipBob's the best. So yeah.

IVW-00219,ShipBob,Megan O'Leary,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Megan O'Leary, Head of Merchandising & Logistics at ShineOn
Company Snapshot ShineOn is a small print-on-demand jewelry and gift manufacturer headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, providing custom-engraved jewelry, accessories, and personalized gifts for e-commerce merchants across North America and Europe, specializing in in-house production and rapid fulfillment.
Primer Megan rejected ShipBob's pricing after evaluating them to outsource non-personalized products from their 15,000 square foot facility.
Perspective ShipBob's rates exceeded competitors and included margin built into shipping costs. Megan needed to maintain ShineOn's own shipping accounts to preserve volume discounts critical for their production items. The pricing structure would have eliminated profitability for the pick-and-pack portion of their business they sought to outsource. Additionally, ShipBob missed their initial pricing deadline and later offered standard negotiation tactics when Megan declined—approaches she views as time-wasting rather than partnership-building.
Pulse • Embedded shipping margins — ShipBob built profit into shipping rates → eliminated deal profitability compared to competitors • Own shipping account requirement — maintaining volume discounts essential for production items → ShipBob's model incompatible with needs • Inventory management gap — competitors offered automated reorder recommendations → ShineOn chose to keep operations in-house

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: What motivated you to evaluate new 3PL vendors in the first place? And where were you coming from?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, so we've really grown our company over these past few years and the production part of our company has grown pretty dramatically. And so I started. But a big piece of our business is the pick pieces, things that don't need to be personalized, going to the end customer, being a POD company, things that, our bread and butter, keep the lights on but don't need as handheld as going through the machines, being engraved, being printed on and and so forth. So what we were looking for was a partner that could take this pick part of the business. The more like easy part of the business for us so we could really focus in on our, our warehouse space and our capacity for the production and really growing that side of the business that's been taking off with our. The, the B2B side and is really a much more profitable piece of the business as well.
Drew Giovannoli: And you were managing your own warehouse?
Megan O'Leary: We do, yeah. We have a warehouse. We have a 15,000 square foot warehouse down in Lutz, Florida. We just moved to it. Well, we're just moving to another one instead of.
Drew Giovannoli: How did you go about finding vendors and what was your short list after that?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, so we have looked at 3PL companies for a while for different reasons around the company over the past few years. So I've interviewed quite a few. And so from that as I set up more in person interviews to understand the cost, the scope, understand who might be a good fit for what we were looking for. That's how I talked to a couple different companies and went through the interview process. But I would say it wasn't necessarily like a one time interview. I've done it multiple times over the past few years. So I was kind of able to figure out who I want to go with. I went with to interview ShipBob because of their. How expansive they are and they have a lot of warehouse points in a lot of key areas. So the time to get to the customer would be short and being able to support eventually multiple warehouses. But we are really looking to start with one warehouse. And the reason for that was because of inventory control. Being able to make sure we had the inventory position in the correct places. Minimize the complexities around inventory purchases and making sure things are sent to the right locations.
Drew Giovannoli: What was your evaluation criteria as you decided should we go with 3PL?
Megan O'Leary: I had like 26 different questions, maybe more than that that I asked each 3PL company. But some, some of them were obviously pricing was a massive driver needed to see if it was going to make financial sense for us. Being able to use our own shipping accounts was a huge perk by being able to continue to grow our own shipping accounts. Otherwise if we were to take that piece off of our shipping accounts it can dramatically change our shipping rates that we're getting for our production items. So being able to maintain our own shipping account so we maintain our status more or less like with these shipping companies and being able to see, the SLAs were important, the receiving fees, how things are being received in the inventory, timing and frequency, the. The time, the estimated time in transit to those different areas and being able to receive products in. So if we're boating products in how close they were to the port or what the time was, what the process was to get it to them if they would be able to take possession at port and get it to their warehouses or. We still had to coordinate that. So yeah, I had a long list of a bunch of different topics to go over when vetting the companies.
Drew Giovannoli: Was there anything about your industry that you are looking for industry expertise in as you went to the 3PLs?
Megan O'Leary: No, not necessarily.
Drew Giovannoli: Who made it to the starting line of your evaluation?
Megan O'Leary: I evaluated over time because our needs had changed throughout years of what we were looking for. We were also sitting on the precipice of our lease expiring at our current facility. And so looking at the facilities and seeing like, okay, do we want to. Do we need to grow and just say, like, yes, we're going to bring this in house? Or are we going to be able to maintain the same size or downsize our facility by outsourcing some of this? So we were sitting right on that. That precipice, which is where these conversations were happening fairly quickly. So some of the rates I would say were like. When I received them from ShipBob, that was the biggest driver for me was we got the rates. I took a look at what it was going to look like and I was like, this is going to be a lot more expensive than what we're paying for right now, which is going to take kind of to. My margin is actually just not going to end up being profitable for us if we were to that way. So that was the driver for me with not going forward with ShipBob. Ultimately we decided to just go ahead and keep it in house. But I will say that the rates with ShipBob were more expensive than competitors rates that we received. And it was a lot of like, they baked their margin into shipping costs. And so it didn't make sense for us to move forward with them as they wanted to use their shipping accounts, which in turn made it so we would have paid more in shipping for our items. And it just wouldn't have. It just wouldn't have worked out for us.
Drew Giovannoli: Beyond the price, is there anything you can share about how easy or difficult it was or how long it took to get pricing?
Megan O'Leary: We pulled our information out of ShipStation, they gave us the criteria they needed. We passed that over. I will say that like the timeline, the deadlines that were provided to me by our account rep were missed. And so it took a little bit longer than we were hoping in order to get the pricing sent back over to us. But he did end up doing it like it was in an off hour. I want to say it was like in the middle and I was like 8, 9pm something like that. And he ended up passing him over to me. So I was able to take a look at it over a weekend, but it wasn't in the original identified time frame if I remember correctly. So it took a little bit longer than we were hoping for. And then after I let them know that like, hey, this pricing didn't work. My biggest frustration with companies is when they say like, oh well, let me know it didn't work and I'll go back to my team and see what we can do normal. And it's like now, like we're good. I don't have time for like the back and forth and to kind of try and make it work for you all. And that's not necessarily just ShipBob. It's, it's a strategy companies use. Right. Like they put it out there, we say no and then they kind of say like, okay, well let's go back and work on it. But at that point for me it's kind of like opportunities are gone because I'm not going to keep coming back if it didn't work the first time. I've already done the analysis. I'm not going to kind of keep digging into it in order to try to force what is a square peg in a round hole. So I'd say it was, it was fine. It just, I didn't want to have the back and forth to see if it was going to end up working.
Drew Giovannoli: If pricing matched your pricing and it was set up in a way where you kept your own rates, were the benefits of ShipBob strong enough to have made a switch?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, yeah, I would have made the switch.
Drew Giovannoli: What are the top strengths that would have made you make the switch even if pricing was on par with what you're paying today?
Megan O'Leary: In order, like the benefits? Is that what you're asking? Like, what would the benefits have been? So the benefits would have been we would have been able to reduce our warehouse size, which in turn would have saved us some money in order to not have to have as big as a facility. We would have been able to be more hands off as far as the. The day today, the assembly of the products. We would have been able to shift our internal focus on just, hey, let's make sure the buys are coming through, let's make sure inventory is correct. And then we would just be able to focus a lot more on production and growing that side of the business and allowing the piece that operates pretty autonomously to just continue to operate fairly autonomously. So the benefits would have been able to not be as distracted, I would say, especially as you go into key holiday time frames. But the big, we offer a lot of perks with like two day shipping, overnight shipping, full economy shipping, and so those add additional selling days. So making sure that all that criteria is met and we're using our shipping accounts is. Is a big, important piece of it.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that made ShipBob stand out in a positive or negative light compared to competitors?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah. So one thing that another competitor was offering was help with the inventory management. So as items like they would help make recommendations or let us know when things were getting low by evaluating the days of supply they had and how that product was turning out in order to send us a recommendation, hey, you're starting to get low in this warehouse. You need to place another order. Here's how much we recommend ordering based off of how this product is selling out of this warehouse. That takes a lot of the analysis and guesswork off of my end. So that was something that stood out to me. With another competitor, it's like even less work that we have to do because the issue with having things across multiple warehouses is you have to maintain inventory in those warehouses and they all sell differently. So it adds complexity. So I think that it's. That's an additional perk that could be offered by ShipBob.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve a company like yours?
Megan O'Leary: I mean the vendor management piece is a big one. Right. Like being able to give a 3PL the opportunity in order to just operate pretty autonomously. Hey, I'll give you contacts to my vendors and you can just kind of kick the PO over to me to approve when you pass it out. When you're running low on inventory and need to place another supply, we can give you the lead. Times like being able to manage the inventory and send us recommendations on purchases would be a huge one. Just to be able to take that additional load off and they do their own analysis.
Drew Giovannoli: Is that something that you've seen at all?
Megan O'Leary: I've seen it through like inventory management companies inventory management system. So it's absolutely out there. Being able to have that be a part of the inventory process and. And that's being offered through 3PL would wildly incentivized like a change because then it's even more hands off and you don't have to worry about it. And it just kind of operates on its own and a PO could just be kicked over. And I say, yep, that actually looks good. We have. That's an approved PO. Go ahead and just send it over to my vendor. So that way it's. It's even more hands off and you're just kind of in the monitor stance. That would be a huge benefit. Huge, huge benefit. So that would probably be my biggest recommendation to a 3PL company. Would just be just kind of the soup to nuts management.
Drew Giovannoli: Any feedback on the sales engagement, the pitch and the demo?
Megan O'Leary: Yeah, there really wasn't a demo. I would say it was more of an intro call where we were talking about what I was looking for and then what they would be able to offer. So there was. There was a lot of conversation around who we are, what we're doing, what I'm looking for, the scale in which we were looking to. To do and then what ShipBob really was in the network. I would say there was a lot of conversation around. I wanted to start with one warehouse and he was asking why and would I consider going to multiple warehouses. And it really came down to the inventory management as to why I wouldn't want to do that. Which is again where that other piece could kind of come in handy saying like, okay, we'll manage the inventory for you and we'll move them around through the warehouses as need be. So. So yeah, I think that there really wasn't as much as a demo. Is that part of it? But it wasn't pushy. I would say very informative for them to understand a lot more about. And then I. I was able to. To ask the questions and understand a bit more about ShipBob and what makes them different in their eyes. But yeah. Does that answer your question?

IVW-00220,ShipBob,Kristine Cass,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Kristine Cass, CFO at Pink Stork
Company Snapshot Pink Stork is a small women's health and wellness company headquartered in St. Augustine, Florida, providing supplements and wellness products for fertility, pregnancy, postpartum, and nursing to consumers and families across North America and select international markets, specializing in third-party-tested, women-owned manufacturing.
Primer Kristine compared ShipBob against keeping their internal warehouse and found flexibility more valuable than potential cost savings.
Perspective Kristine's quarterly review revealed costs would roughly even out between options. ShipBob would reduce shipping costs but increase labor expenses, while Pink Stork operates efficiently in a low-cost area. The decisive factor became operational flexibility—Pink Stork's ability to rapidly relabel products, handle same-day Amazon shipments, and pivot quickly on inventory decisions. These agile capabilities, essential for their supplement business model, would be compromised with any 3PL arrangement despite ShipBob's strong reputation and technology platform.
Pulse • Operational flexibility requirement — need for same-day relabeling and Amazon shipments → eliminated 3PL consideration entirely • Cost parity analysis — ShipBob's lower shipping offset by higher labor costs → removed financial incentive for change • Business model mismatch — 90% Amazon FBA volume versus 10% direct-to-consumer → insufficient benefit from outsourcing minority portion

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: What triggered your organization considering a new 3PL, and where were you starting from?
Kristine Cass: Yeah, so we currently manage our own warehouse, and every once in a while, we really want to make sure that we are doing what's best for our company and staying up to date with all the latest technology and processes just that are. That are important for our industry. And so last quarter, part of what I was focusing on was reviewing a lot of our practices and. And really our organizational setup to make sure that we were. We had the best setup for where we are today. And so we hadn't evaluated 3PLs seriously in probably since COVID. So it had been a while, and the. The marketplace had changed. The way Amazon manages shipments, the way customers expect website shipments to go through, all of that has evolved. And so this was a good time for us to evaluate whether moving to a 3PL would be preferable to maintaining our. Our own internal warehouse.
Drew Giovannoli: What criteria did you have when you looked at options?
Kristine Cass: Well, cost, of course, the cost is obviously a factor, but one of the big factors for us was flexibility. So I would say cost efficiency and flexibility were the three factors that we were looking at.
Drew Giovannoli: How were you defining flexibility?
Kristine Cass: I think one of the things. And this actually, this was the, the deal breaker. This was the. Ended up being the most important factor. Once we identified that the others were okay. We for our business like to stay very nimble, which means for us that we like to be able to move very fast on Amazon. And sometimes that can require us to do things with inventory that a 3PL isn't set up for. And so that flexibility was, was the deciding factor for us. So for instance, we sell dietary supplements. So for instance, like if we have this bottle, we decide, hey, the market has shifted on Amazon. We need to change the label. Right. We need to be able to order labels, get them in within a week and have our people sit down and take this label off and put another label on and ship it out to Amazon. And so while that's not the majority of our, of our work, we do need to be able to maintain that. That capability. And that's something that we thought that we would lose with a 3PL.
Drew Giovannoli: How important is industry specific experience?
Kristine Cass: I wouldn't say it's essential. I do think it would. It is important. Nice to have. Yeah, I think it would, it would help build trust if I know that they have clients that are in our industry and understand what's required to support our customers.
Drew Giovannoli: How would you rank ShipBob on well suited for your industry? From 0 to 10?
Kristine Cass: I would say 10.
Drew Giovannoli: What other vendors did you look at?
Kristine Cass: We weren't looking at a lot of other 3PLs. We were really looking at do we want a 3PL and ShipBob was our kind of. It was honestly the only one I looked at and if we went with a 3PL, we would have gone with ShipBob. I think they have a really great record in the 3PL industry and their scale gave us a lot of confidence. So if we were going to go with 3PL, we would have gone with ShipBob. So we were really comparing not ShipBob versus other 3PLs, but ShipBob 3PL versus default internal warehouse versus a more holistic approach through Pattern, which essentially would own our e-commerce business.
Drew Giovannoli: What gave you that impression about ShipBob having the best record?
Kristine Cass: I just heard about ShipBob. Seen them referenced in plenty of places. Whether it's through industry lists that I'm on or chats that I'm on, the reviews are strong. I think they just have that reputation in the industry as being a very big player in the 3PL space. It's not necessarily hearing about them from, marketing lists. It's more about, I'm, I'm in a bunch of groups, whether it's WhatsApp groups or email groups or LinkedIn groups of e-commerce sellers. And I hear ShipBob referenced as a. As a solid 3PL by them.
Drew Giovannoli: You mentioned Pattern. What is that?
Kristine Cass: It's a completely different business model. So, when we currently sell as an e-commerce seller, we are the seller of record for our products on Amazon. And with Pattern, they would be the seller of record. So essentially we would sell our products wholesale to Pattern and they would manage the listings, the fulfillment, customer service, everything. So it'd be more of a wholesale relationship. We'd be essentially outsourcing our entire Amazon business as opposed to just outsourcing the fulfillment piece. Outsourcing our entire Amazon business to Pattern. And part of that is gaining access to their fulfillment networks, which have the best internal technology to support Amazon sellers.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you end up going with them or staying in house?
Kristine Cass: Staying in house. And the reason we. So there's a couple of reasons here. Giving up. If we went with Pattern, we would be giving up a lot of control in and for our business. That was too much control for us to relinquish given the stage of business that we're at. So we weren't comfortable with that. And so given that we weren't going to move with them, the question became, okay, do we want to switch to 3PL or maintain our own warehouse? And when I looked at the cost breakdown, the cost came out roughly similar. I think that ShipBob would save us a decent chunk on shipping costs, but the labor costs would be significantly higher. We run a pretty low cost labor. We're in a low labor cost area and we run our warehouse pretty efficiently. So the ship, the labor cost would be higher with ShipBob, the freight cost would be lower, kind of evened out. And so the cost wasn't really a deciding factor. There wasn't enough of a cost advantage to overcome the, the loss of flexibility.
Drew Giovannoli: Were there any other weaknesses or barriers with ShipBob?
Kristine Cass: No. I actually really enjoyed the time that I spent with the sales rep. I thought he was very, he was, he was great. I really enjoyed the time spoke with him. He was very responsive, very clear, very trustworthy. No complaints or concerns about him. I thought he was great to work with. So I appreciate his time. It was really the. There wasn't enough of a cost advantage to make up for the loss in flexibility.
Drew Giovannoli: How did the pricing process go? Was it burdensome to collect the data? How long did it take?
Kristine Cass: Yeah, no, I thought the process was fine. He gave me clear instructions about what data that they, what data they needed. I was able to download that pretty seamlessly from ShipStation. I don't think it took me more than a half hour to kind of clean up the data and provide them what they needed. And they, I, I don't remember the exact timeline turnaround time, but it was definitely well within my expectations. I don't recall having to wait for him for, for a long time.
Drew Giovannoli: What did you really like about ShipBob?
Kristine Cass: Yeah. I think that the scale is important because it shows a confidence in the industry. Right. When shipments are late, we get dinged across platforms, so we just can't have that. It's kind of like a zero tolerance. Right. If we get dinged too much, then TikTok shop takes us down, we get customer complaints, all that. So the, the scale gave me confidence that ShipBob would be able to meet our standards and our customers standards and that we work with standards for shipping, which is essential. Right. But so I didn't have any concerns about that. The scale gave me concerns. I, or gave me confidence. I think the technology also looked good. Like I didn't have. The dashboard looked fine. I didn't have any. It was not lacking in any way. Certainly a little bit different from what we do internally where we're. Got a couple different systems we're cobbling together. The system looked, looked like it would be very productive and easy to navigate. So no concerns there. The only concern I had was concerns relating to the flexibility. So for instance, you mentioned like customers wanting to add inserts in or clients wanting to add vendors, whatever we call them brands wanting to add inserts into packages. Right. So that's important to us. But what it did seem like was that, we like to change our mind on that regularly. And that's the piece where it's like, okay, yeah, maybe they, in theory they could handle that, but could they really turn that on a dime, if we say, oh, yeah, we've got all these inserts, but no, starting Monday, we want to add in a different insert or in these types of packages, we want to have these two inserts or, hey, now we're doing TikTok shop orders. So those need to have a different insert or they need to go in a different type of packaging. And while I think, in theory, I think ShipBob would be able to handle that, I don't think they'd be able to handle it with the speed. Yeah, because it would be. We have to kind of go through those requests with. I know that there are some of those that you could put through the portal, but we would need confirmation from a real person that. That those were happening.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you envision maintaining that flexibility as you continue to grow?
Kristine Cass: I don't envision us getting rid of the warehouse in three years. If we talk about 20, 30, maybe. There's also real estate factors involved, like we own the warehouse, so, getting rid of the warehouse, outsourcing fulfillment is one piece. We're also holding inventory and all of that. And like, just outsourcing the web store would get rid of one part of what our warehouse does, but there's other parts that our warehouse would still do. And that was another reason, another consideration that I had is that while I have strong confidence that ShipBob could handle the web store fulfillment orders coming from Pink Stork.com that go through Shopify and get sent out and probably TikTok shop fulfillment, too. We could hook that up to ShipBob. The. The piece that's. The vast majority of our business is shipping products direct to Amazon's warehouse. The FBA orders and those, I had a little bit less confidence in ShipBob to handle. And, that. I know they. They assured me that they can handle that, but I don't think that they're used to businesses that have our structure. Right. Like, for us, that's 90% of the volume that goes out the door and the web store orders and the TikTok shop, that's 10%. So we'd be talking about outsourcing the 10% and keeping the 90%. And at that point, does it really make sense to do it? We're only getting rid of the 10%.
Drew Giovannoli: What gave you less confidence that they could handle the Amazon FBA orders?
Kristine Cass: Again, it's the speed. We like to be able to make decisions on those very quickly. So if we're seeing, hey, this product is selling well today, we need to get another order up this afternoon. We could put that into the system. Okay, we could put that into the system, but I'm not confident we'll get out that day.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you change same day within Amazon?
Kristine Cass: A couple things. So, for instance, we have, we have products that we have the same, stuff in the bottle that we sell under a couple labels, couple different labels just to different customer groups. And so it might be, hey, one of those is taking off. We need to send more in. And to do that, we might have to relabel a product that's sitting here labeled as something else to the one that's doing well and ship it out the door. And so that's not something that ShipBob could turn around same day. Yeah, or maybe they could, but it would be a real interruption to their process. Right. Yeah, exactly. We do a lot of pivoting. And so, while I think ShipBob would work really well for business, that's very stable. And yes, 95% of our orders are coming from very stable products. There's always those one off things that happen. And there's also, there are manufacturing issues that happen or the manufacturer put the wrong label on and now we need to, or we need to quarantine this stock and whatever. And, and I think ShipBob can handle those edge cases, but maybe not as quickly or as seamlessly as we could do it in house.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were CEO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve companies like Pink Stork?
Kristine Cass: Amazon inbound. I would say, looking through, understanding a little bit more about what Pattern's doing on the Amazon inbound side and replicating that without the Pattern business model. So one of the things that they do is they, when we send a shipment to Amazon, we go through Amazon's back end. It says, do you want to send an inventory? We click the buttons, it tells us where to send it, how much to send, we pack the shipment and it goes off. And we're subject to whatever, wherever Amazon told us to ship it, and whatever the check in time at that destination is, we're just stuck with it. So if we, if Amazon sent it to a warehouse that was backed up, that product could be sitting there waiting for up to 10 days before it gets checked in, which means that our customers can order it. Pattern has started to find workarounds to this where they're, they have their system constantly scanning the Amazon delivery centers or Amazon fulfillment centers available delivery time slots. And so their, their system is scanning that constantly. When it finds an open time slot, it grabs it and then figures out, okay, what can we put on a truck to go and fills an entire truck. So like, if Amazon, if ShipBob has enough volume going to Amazon, that's a business model right there. And while I know, I think that the ShipBob option right now for Amazon is kind of what we're doing already, like that's not an advantage, it's just doing what we're doing today with a little bit less flexibility. But if it could use the technology to kind of reduce that lead time to get into Amazon, that would be an advantage.

IVW-00222,ShipBob,Leo Wan,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Leo Wan, Manager, Supply Chain at Viori
Company Snapshot Viori is a small beauty and personal care company headquartered in Orem, Utah, providing natural, plastic-free shampoo and conditioner bars, as well as body care products, to consumers across North America and select international markets, specializing in Longsheng rice water formulas with direct ingredient sourcing.
Primer Leo paused his ShipBob evaluation mid-process when other business priorities required immediate attention.
Perspective Leo never received a formal proposal before redirecting focus to other company priorities. Viori maintains a continuous pursuit of better 3PL solutions, evaluating options like ShipBob and ShipHero against their current ShipStation setup. Cost remains their primary criterion, followed by functionality suitable for their straightforward fulfillment needs. Leo scored ShipBob a nine for industry suitability, citing their comprehensive functionality and impressive mobile app, though he emphasized their preference for simple solutions without excess features they wouldn't utilize.
Pulse • Cost-driven evaluation — pricing remains the primary decision factor → ShipStation retained due to competitive pricing for basic needs • Interrupted evaluation process — business priorities shifted before receiving ShipBob proposal → evaluation paused rather than formally rejected
 • Feature-value mismatch — ShipBob offers extensive functionality beyond Viori's simple fulfillment requirements → creates pricing premium for unused capabilities

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: What prompted you to evaluate a new or different 3PL solution?
Leo Wan: There are several aspects of it. The first thing is definitely cost, number one priority for us at this time. The second is the functionality, like how easy to access or how easy like for our team to pick up. Yeah, I would say these two are the main focus of. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Was it that your previous solution was not meeting your expectations as it relates to cost and functionality?
Leo Wan: No, I mean we are constantly looking at, to find like a better or like cheaper solution. We are always open to explore, new opportunities or like any way if there is a better cost or better 3PL solution out there, it's available. So. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: What were your evaluation criteria?
Leo Wan: I would say cost, functionality, like yeah, pretty much the same. Cost is our, at this point of our business, cost is our like number one focus and functionality wise. I mean we are, we're a smaller company and like, we don't need like need the solution to be too fancy and you know, we, we. Yeah. So basically just like looking for solution that cost with a good price and suitable for our business model at this time. That's what we are looking at right now. And definitely, I mean like the quality of service, that's one thing we look at as well. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Tell me more about how you think about a good price or what constitutes an attractive price.
Leo Wan: I don't have, I don't have a data on hand with me right now. But basically it's like. Yeah, basically how we would compare is like, we have some data, how much, how much, how many, like shipment. We go out like each month and then we kind of take that scenario. If you put in some other solutions, if they can come back with better pricing, then that's how, how we would determine if that's a, good pricing or not. Basically it's compared to our current service.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there any needs that are specific to your particular industry that you were considering?
Leo Wan: Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't think of any.
Drew Giovannoli: How well suited do you believe ShipBob is to your industry on a scale of 0 to 10?
Leo Wan: I say a nine.
Drew Giovannoli: What were some of the things that stood out to put you in a position to score them that way?
Leo Wan: I mean as I was talking to ShipBob the other time, basically he, he understood everything that, that our needs are and like most of the, on the most part I feel like, I feel like ShipBob like functionality are able to like meet what our needs are. Yeah, that's great.
Drew Giovannoli: Would you say that makes it attractive to the industry or specific to your company?
Leo Wan: Yeah, I feel like it's. Yeah. Attractive enough. Both.
Drew Giovannoli: Were there any other vendors that seem to be a good fit for your industry?
Leo Wan: No, not at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli: Who were some of the other vendors that you evaluated?
Leo Wan: With it evaluate? Let me see, what was the name of that ship? Hero. And then I think that will be the most recent one that we, that we looked at and. Yeah. I can't remember the others.
Drew Giovannoli: Who did you end up deciding on?
Leo Wan: I mean, we always been using ShipStation, so we are sticking with ShipStation at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli: At what point was ShipBob eliminated from the evaluation process?
Leo Wan: So it was after. Let me see. How can I. How do I put this? So it wasn't. There's no, not, not like a point of like, eliminated, but it just. We, we got caught up with like, some, we were focusing on some other, like, aspect in the company at, in the company at the moment. So we kind of put that project on the side. And, and, and I mean, we're, we, we're not like, dissatisfied with what we have currently, so there's not like an urgent need to switch it right away. So there wasn't. So that's why I said, like, there wasn't a, like. No, no, no. But like, we kind of put the project on the side at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli: Were you ever able to get a proposal from ShipBob?
Leo Wan: We redirect to the other stuff before the proposal. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: What is it about ShipStation that you feel like is most compelling over ShipBob?
Leo Wan: I mean, like, to be honest, we just haven't. Like I said, we haven't got the full proposal, so there wasn't. I would say we don't have. Know enough to say no to ShipBob? So yeah like I mentioned, we just had some other aspect in the business we need to focus on at this moment. So that's. Yeah. So there's not. I mean we use a key still using ShipStation just because we are familiar with it, the pricing are good and that's it. Not saying ShipBob is not good compared to ShipStation. We just switch to other. We just have other things to focus at this time.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you perceive to be ShipBob's strengths versus others?
Leo Wan: I'll say the functionality. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there any specific functions that are especially relevant to your business?
Leo Wan: Let me see if I still have some notes from. I would say it's. Is that a full stack fulfillment platform thing? That's like. And then I'm really impressed with that, that phone app that they have as well. Yeah that's something that we don't have or we're not using at the moment. But yeah I can see that it is kind of cool.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you have any perspective on ShipBob's weaknesses versus others?
Leo Wan: I can't think of any at this moment.
Drew Giovannoli: What would you say are some of the most compelling attributes of ShipStation as it relates to your industry?
Leo Wan: I mean it's easy access, can connect it to like a lot of the tools that you're using. For example our ERP system, also our Shopify like page and like it's a connect connectivity. Yes, that helps. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: How does ShipStation stack up relative to the marketplace around price?
Leo Wan: As of right now we haven't found like, like a, a better pricing of the 3PL solution then ShipStation. I haven't like, like I said except for like ShipBob. I have. We haven't gone into that div yet. Yeah but at the, at the moment we haven't found anything that like provides what we need with such a low price. With a better price or because like we're not like we, we're not like fancy we. We just like using like we, we're pretty simple on like in terms of our fulfillment. So a lot of the like for example ShipBob, like you guys provide a lot of functionality but like a lot of the things that we, we don't need it. So that being said, like yeah, ShipStation can provide like our basic needs with low cost. That's pretty much what it was.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you recall anything that the ShipBob sales team did well?
Leo Wan: Yeah, ShipBob I think only spoke to him. He was really friendly. He's knowledgeable, really relatable to a lot of things that we are doing. So he kind of, by, by talking to him he kind of know like understand our 3PL models are and like what are some of the needs and it wasn't pushy. He was really good at explaining like what he has and like understanding basically what our needs is. Yeah, the, the whole meeting was, was, was good with him.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that you think the sales team could have done better?
Leo Wan: No, I think he did great.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you think is a reasonable turnaround time to receive pricing once you give them the data?
Leo Wan: Well, I mean ideally I would expect like within, I'll say most optimal. I would say a day or two on a reasonable timeline would be like like a week. Yeah. And that, that, that's kind of how I look at it. Like if it, you can get it one or two days perfect within a week. I mean still good. Yeah, I mean, I mean for us like we, we kind of mentioned we are not like, like in a hurry or in an urgent switching to another platform or switch solution. So like yeah, I would say generally a week it's fine.
Drew Giovannoli: How would you prefer to engage with the pricing information?
Leo Wan: I would say email first and then there's anything that not understanding. Well, I need to be clarified that follow up with by ourselves rep.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were to leave ShipStation in nine months, what's happened to cause that change?
Leo Wan: I mean it's the go back to our. Our need. It's. Like a service that with good pricing at the same time can meet our need. That's. Yeah. With better pricing than ShipStation. That. What I am saying is.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of ShipBob, what would you change to better serve a company like yours?
Leo Wan: I mean. Yeah. I mean just better pricing. Yeah. I mean that's a focus of our business right now and you know. Yeah, that's. That's the whole. Yeah. Pricing with. With remaining the quality of service. Obviously put it this way. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there specific elements of a service experience that are most important to you?
Leo Wan: I would say, I'll say is how easy to access the help from ShipBob. Like for example, like if there's. If there's things that needs to be troubleshoot, if there's anyone to help, how easily to reach to ShipBob to for help and how. How they handle the case. I will say that will be the number one thing.

IVW-00225,ShipBob,Morgan Lee,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Morgan Lee, CFO at Sarah's Silks
Sarah's Silks is a small retail and manufacturing company headquartered in Forestville, California, providing silk and wooden toys and dress-up costumes for children to families, schools, and boutique toy shops across North America, Europe, and Australia. They specialize in open-ended, Waldorf-inspired imaginative play products made from natural materials.
Primer Morgan evaluated ShipBob against three competitors but stayed with Flexport due to misaligned sales approach.
Perspective ShipBob's sales process prioritized comprehensive onboarding over targeted pilot programs. Morgan sought to test ShipBob with specific SPS Commerce fulfillment—a small-volume use case requiring nuanced inventory management across direct-to-consumer, wholesale, and drop-shipping channels. Despite ShipBob's cost advantage of 5-10 cents per pick below competitors, the sales team emphasized completing detailed pricing forms rather than addressing operational questions about inventory flow and SKU preparation. The mismatch between ShipBob's preference for full-catalog transitions and Sarah's Silks' desire for low-risk, incremental adoption ultimately prevented engagement.
Pulse • Cost leadership — ShipBob delivered lowest pick rates at 5-10 cents per item below competitors → positioned as clear price winner
• Sales process mismatch — emphasis on comprehensive onboarding over pilot programs → prevented trial engagement with small-volume use case
• Switching cost advantage — Flexport's incumbent status with existing inventory and systems → created high barrier for competitors despite pricing gaps

Drew Giovannoli: Can you tell me what kind of warehousing fulfillment you were using and what motivated you to start evaluating 3PLs?
Morgan Lee: We currently use the Flexport 3PL and we were just looking at what the switching cost would look like. And then also kind of just comparing the pricing models between ShipBob and a couple other 3PLs and then also what we were currently using, which is Flexport. That was kind of the impetus.
Drew Giovannoli: Besides cost, were there any other evaluation criteria as you looked at other vendors?
Morgan Lee: There was like kind of like more soft things. Like did it seem like we would be able to get really quick customer service? Did it seem like other people were happy with like good personal reviews from other people? I think those are the two main ones.
Drew Giovannoli: How do you think Flexport does today? What do you think its strengths and weaknesses are?
Morgan Lee: I'd say that the strengths are customer service and like being able to access someone pretty high up really quickly. And then also being able to get, if there's a problem, getting it resolved. I'd say that's like their main strength. And then probably the biggest weakness is they're pretty new in terms of, I mean they used to be the Shopify fulfillment network. They got brought out. They're pretty new in terms of like connecting with drop shipping programs, connecting with SPS. That's been a little bit harder.
Drew Giovannoli: Who else made it into the evaluation set for you as you looked outside of Flexport?
Morgan Lee: There was obviously ShipBob. There was a company called Next Smartship. I don't know if you've heard of them. There was Ship Fusion and those were the three that I took calls with.
Drew Giovannoli: Who did you end up going with?
Morgan Lee: I ended up just staying with Flexport.
Drew Giovannoli: If you looked at it like a race and Flexport and ShipBob and the others at the beginning of the race, do you think that any of them started out with an advantage because of reputation or maybe Flexport because of your experience with them?
Morgan Lee: I'd say Flexport started way ahead just because all of our products already there and the switching costs are high for the others. And also just like the operational lift to kind of switch our systems over. So they definitely start in the lead. And then I'd say Ship Fusion and Next Smart Ship started behind ShipBob. Just because I know more people that use ShipBob. Like, I feel like they're like, probably the biggest, maybe one of the biggest 3PLs or the biggest 3PL in the US and so I just had a lot of good personal reviews from them.
Drew Giovannoli: As the race started and progressed, did any of them gain on Flexport or change positions along the way?
Morgan Lee: Good question. There's a couple different use cases that I was looking for. It was kind of nuanced. So like I said, Flexport's biggest con is this lack of like customization on the wholesale fulfillment side. And so Next Smart Ship and ShipBob, I felt like could have ticked both of those boxes. The reason I went with Next Smart Ship and then I ended up using some of Next Smart Ship services for wholesale, particularly because they don't have a warehouse in the US and we could send the products to their China warehouse from our vendors and then ship it to international customers so that we don't have to pay the tariff importing it into the US and so since they could do the wholesale side of things and they could do out of country fulfillment with a warehouse, not in the US that was really, really helpful for us. It saved us a lot on tariff costs. And so that was a big thing that happened. And then with ShipBob, it seemed like I was pondering using them for some of like our SPS Commerce fulfillment, but it seemed like I was worried about it being too small of a volume or not being a meaningful customer. Like for Flexport, we're a meaningful customer with our volume and so we get really high service. I was worried about having very low volume and not really be given any priority at ShipBob.
Drew Giovannoli: Was that based on any feedback you got or just a general perception that ShipBob's large?
Morgan Lee: In the sales call, I got the feeling that they were more interested in getting the entire business as opposed to just that one piece that I wanted to do. And so I didn't really feel like we could talk about it very much. And that kind of made me feel that way.
Drew Giovannoli: What are the strengths and weaknesses of ShipBob? What do you think they did well?
Morgan Lee: They were definitely the low cost provider. So they were, they had the cheapest rates in terms of the shipping rates were the same, but the picking rates were the cheapest out of everyone. They came in about 5 to 10 cents cheaper per item as a pick rate. So that was definitely the biggest. They definitely would have been the cheapest option. And then they also had the widest breadth of fulfillment partners, dropship providers. We do drop ship with a couple retailers and then complying with like strict SPS Commerce regular like rules from retailers, I felt like that was definitely their biggest strength.
Drew Giovannoli: How about weaknesses and the biggest reason you did not go with them?
Morgan Lee: The biggest reason was it felt like I wanted to give it a try with some of the smaller pieces. And it seemed like either that wasn't like in the interest of who I was talking to. And the conversation kind of kept on going back to like, I had like this form that I was supposed to fill out for like Zone so they could give me like a really accurate pricing model. But I kind of wasn't really interested in an accurate pricing model. I knew they were going to be the cheapest anyways, and so I really wanted to know. I felt like I wasn't really getting the answers that I was trying to look for.
Drew Giovannoli: Were there answers outside of pricing you felt like you weren't getting?
Morgan Lee: I wasn't, I didn't really care that much about pricing. I knew they were going to be the cheapest and so I didn't really want to go through this whole process of filling out a big form just to get the answer of, I already know you guys are going to be the cheapest. It's just these other questions that I need answers to. And it felt like maybe I didn't do a great job of asking about it, but it felt like that wasn't getting through.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you mind sharing what types of questions you were trying to get to?
Morgan Lee: I was really trying to understand how the inventory flowed between can we use the same inventory for our direct to fulfillment, can we use that same inventory and then for SPS fulfillment, and then can we still use that same inventory for drop shipping? And then if that is the case, I was really trying to get to the heart of how do we know that you're going to be prepping this SPS SKU in the correct way versus how you're prepping this direct to fulfillment SKU versus how you're going to be prepping it for drop shipping. And I didn't really have a great confidence that that was going to be worked out. I felt like maybe I worded the question wrong, but yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: If they had come back to you and said, hey, we would value you and a senior person came in and said, hey, we value even the small part of your business. Here's the answers to those questions. And we don't need this full official pricing, but like, general pricing, would that have swayed you to try them and would you be open to them coming back?
Morgan Lee: That probably would have changed the outcome. And it probably honestly still would change the outcome now. I'd say yes to both.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything else about that sales experience that was positive or negative? Things they could learn from some competitor that did exceptionally well?
Morgan Lee: I felt like maybe I got really lucky at Flexport and I just started off with someone a little bit higher up, but I really felt like he really understood like, what I was trying to ask for and understood like, the specifics of like, what we really, what was really important to me and what was really important to the business and kind of what he felt was like, the value add. Instead of like, kind of listening to me and telling me what our value add was going to be. And then it felt like he made the process, like he basically didn't need anything from me to get the process rolling and to make it really seamless and to start really small and then kind of build the trust with like one or two or three SKUs and then kind of scale from there. That was a big difference. And it was a lot easier to start with them because they were just asking for like, one or two SKUs. Really low risk as opposed to like, kind of wanting the whole catalog.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you even get to the point at which you were sharing pricing back and forth with ShipBob?
Morgan Lee: Basically, as soon as I like, on the sales call, I was kind of like, yeah, I can try and fill out the sheet and then we'll see what the pricing looks like. But then I just never got around to it. It looks very daunting when I opened it. And it looks hard and it looked unnecessary.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO or CFO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve a company like yours?
Morgan Lee: Probably very similar things, as I've already said, but like be okay like starting small. Be okay like taking on a little bit of volume to like earn some trust and get started and then it can definitely scale really quickly from there. And then I'd also say like try to understand like maybe not what you think the business's strengths are, but like try and like understand what their current problems are and then try and fix those first as opposed to going into something else.
Drew Giovannoli: Where did you go to learn about, get referrals or to see them at an event, read content? What influenced that original evaluation set?
Morgan Lee: I know a lot of people that use 3PLs, like other business leaders, people in the industry that I know a lot of it was just talking to them. They, most of them have tried multiple 3PLs and kind of are really familiar with like what to look out for, what not to look out for, what to ask, what to make sure they're capable of doing before you start with them.

IVW-00226,ShipBob,Amy Fletcher,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Amy Fletcher, Marketplace Manager at Swanson Health
Company Snapshot Swanson Health is a mid-market health and wellness retailer headquartered in Fargo, providing vitamins, supplements, and natural health products to consumers across North America and international markets through direct-to-consumer sales and third-party quality certification of over 26,000 products.
Primer Amy evaluated ShipBob in March but internal communication breakdowns stalled the decision-making process.
Perspective: ShipBob's proposal landed during a warehouse consolidation crisis. In March 2025, Swanson Health was closing their Pennsylvania warehouse and consolidating operations to their Fargo headquarters—creating an operational tunnel vision that sidelined third-party logistics discussions. Despite Amy's enthusiasm for the proposal and her manager's initial interest, the operations team went radio silent across multiple follow-ups over several months. The timing disconnect highlights how even well-positioned vendors can lose momentum when internal priorities shift, particularly at companies with ""this is how we've always done it"" mentalities that resist operational changes despite clear competitive disadvantages in delivery speed.
Pulse • Warehouse consolidation — closing Pennsylvania facility created operational tunnel vision → ShipBob evaluation stalled despite initial interest • Internal communication breakdown — operations team ignored multiple follow-ups from marketplace manager → no decision pathway despite management support
 • Lead time advocacy challenge — marketplace team pushes for faster shipping while operations focuses solely on cost → competitive disadvantage in marketplace delivery speeds

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: Can you share your current state fulfillment and what triggered you to start evaluating three PLs?
Amy Fletcher: Either they reached out to us, or my counterpart, who is no longer at Swanson Health, had reached out to them. When he left in February, I took over and tried to figure out what the conversations were that were being had and had a lengthy conversation with Shipton Bogle at ShipBob and have an email here from March 5th with him just thanking us for the time to connect and all the details. I thought that it was a great conversation and forwarded it along internally to my manager. She is the Chief Transformation Officer at Swanson Health, to be quite frank. In March, we were in the midst of closing down one of two of our warehouses. So we had one in Pennsylvania and then the main headquarters in Fargo warehouse. We were closing down the Pennsylvania warehouse. It just didn't make sense, cost wise operationally anymore to have that warehouse. So that was happening in March. I think that the timing might have not been superb for this conversation to be brought up, because everybody in operations was so focused on getting all the inventory from that warehouse pushed back to our Fargo warehouse. In talking with my manager on phone call, brought this back up to her as well during that time, and she had referred me to send it over to our VP of ops and Director of Ops and get their buy in. I did that, and I honestly never heard back. I think I emailed them three different times over the last couple of months about this, and they have not responded back to me. I'm not sure if it's a I just don't understand what you're sending me or we're not interested in it right now. That's an internal fault that I'm not hearing communication back from the team. I even did just recently reach out when I saw this invite come through a couple weeks ago of we want to chat with you and understand, I was like, hey guys, do you have anything I can provide to this company on where we're at? And I just haven't heard anything. So I know I had mentioned I can tell you what I know right now, but I don't have a lot to go off of. I think that it would be important for our operations team, slash my boss even to be presented what I was presented to have it go directly into their mindset of what actually could happen cost savings wise and sales wise. I think the company has, quite frankly been one of those. This is just how we've always done it companies. Swanson Health's been around since 1969 and my counterpart and I had been really egging the company onto doing increased shipping speeds, obviously increasing our cost to the carriers in general for our FBM orders so that we could get products to customers in a faster manner. Because in looking at the competition out there on marketplaces, we are actually one of the slower companies to be able to deliver by the products. It was always kind of a comment back to us of that would cost more. We are at the lowest rates for a reason. Things are working and we don't have insight into the under the hood of carrier conversations and costs and deals of that matter. So we've been trying to increase our ship times. I think having a direct conversation from the company to Ops plus someone on the marketing side, which would be my manager involved with marketplaces specifically, would be very helpful. I know ShipBob would be helpful for D2C and marketplaces. So obviously that's super beneficial, but I think there needs to be like a better high summary of here's what you guys are showing your customers right now of lead times and here's what we would do for you by being able to have all these different warehouses storing your product and here's the cost and here's your expected sales by showing them shorter lead times.
Drew Giovannoli: If ShipBob came back and did that, what would it take for them to get that meeting? Is that a difficult meeting to set up for you?
Amy Fletcher: I would take it. I would take it to my manager again. So I haven't talked to her since she initially was like, yeah, send it over to Ops and see what they think. Then multiple conversations or forwards to them and kind of radio silence. I think I would now go back to her and be like, hey, I haven't heard from these people. The thing is, she's going to want to know why? Why should we take the time to get them involved? And to me I'd be like, well, look, here's the email change that we've been going off of, but maybe there's something that I can get that's more synthesized. The email that I'm looking at right now has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, like 10 different line item sentences. So maybe it's something a little more condensed that I can share with her, like, hey, we need to do this because it literally will improve our lead times by 50%. And when that happens, sales increase by whatever percent.
Drew Giovannoli: I heard a couple things about why you potentially started this path to explore it. I heard one of your warehouses was shutting down. Two, I heard that there was a desire to improve lead times. And then of course, costs are always a big thing. Did I capture them correctly? Are there other things you think the company would value or care about differently?
Amy Fletcher: The ops team? It's clear to me that every time I have chatted with them about shipping, it's a cost thing. I think that they might hold value close to trust that they work diligently through making sure they're getting the best rates for services. That's their job. By all means, yes, they're doing a great job. I don't know if they've opened their minds to what other options that there are I'm not sure. That's kind of a hot feeling to me is that they're satisfied with what they've done. But so I think cost is going to be big for them just understanding that piece. But for my manager, she is the new GM of marketplaces as of fall of last year with no marketplace experience, but she's garnered a lot over the last six months. Her big thing right now is how do we increase our sales? There's. I mean, we need to be profitable too. So obviously cost again, but increasing sales. I don't personally hear a lot from anyone but myself and my previous counterpart about lead times. They need to improve those as kind of the stepchild of the conversation, something I'm super passionate about. I understand if you're selling on marketplaces or even your D2C, if you're not showing four or five day deliver date, I mean for D to C on marketplaces it has to be two days or three days, then you're just not going to win. They're going to buy from someone else. Because people want it now. So I'd say cost and sales generation from this is going to be really big.
Drew Giovannoli: So if ShipBob has any data from working across all their vendors about the potential sales increase of offering faster shipping times, that could be a useful thing.
Amy Fletcher: Got it.
Drew Giovannoli: How did you find ShipBob? You said they may have reached out to you. I didn't remember if there's anything other, like reputational. You looked them up on Gartner or you did searches or you went to an event, anything.
Amy Fletcher: I think it was my counterpart that had started the initial conversations. I'm not sure if he had been reached out to or if he found them. There's a good potential that he actually did reach out to ShipBob because we were so invested in trying to figure out how we reduce our lead times. He was really operationally minded. So he probably did reach out to ShipBob.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there other vendors that you're looking at also?
Amy Fletcher: I know the Amazon vehicle has reached out to us multiple times. Not sure how they directly stack up against you guys, but it's kind of in the same boat where we've gotten information. It just hasn't gone anywhere. That's the only other one I would know about. I'm not sure if operations team has looked at anything else. I do know when I first brought this up to my boss though, she was actually like, oh, that would be probably a great idea. But unfortunately she just doesn't run that channel. But she has way more obviously pull. She's in the C suite than I would. So if I was able to get her or the operations team on a call, that would be more beneficial.
Drew Giovannoli: As you looked at the vendor for your products, is there anything industry specific you're looking to make sure that the vendor does. You think the company would really care about? How important is it to you that they have support other supplement companies.
Amy Fletcher: Do they have experience in other VMS companies? So then that can. I think that specifically is important. I don't. I just. Because a product is a product, it's more so understanding the ability to ship it and. I mean, I say that. But I also had a note, a question for you or the team of. Can you share who is using your services? That's not necessarily to say you have to tell me that all these VMS brands are using it, but just to see what big name brands are using it.
Drew Giovannoli: What was positive from your interactions with Shipton and other team members?
Amy Fletcher: I think Shipton just overall did a great job of showing us the presentation in March and following up on it multiple times. It's just kind of. It's kind of falling into one of those normal sales processes. I don't want to say normal, but it kind of is. You try and you think you're getting somewhere and then all of a sudden the brand doesn't respond. So I have nothing to say bad about what he did or that sense. I think it's just getting the right people in the room.
Drew Giovannoli: What about negative? Is there anything that you think the ShipBob sales teams could have done better?
Amy Fletcher: I mean nothing is again, maybe just synthesizing it one more time in another follow up email. I know you had sent out a couple of things, LinkedIn and then my email and I quite frankly didn't respond to a couple of them. And then I finally bit on the third or fourth one. So maybe he needed to be a little bit more persistent and send a few more follow ups with consolidated. Just a reminder here's what we can do for you.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you go through getting pricing from ShipBob? Did you make it that far?
Amy Fletcher: Let me get pricing. I can't remember at the moment if we did. I would assume so. Let's see here. Cost structure. I was told the complex needs would be 25 to 30k but real package. Let's see it. It's been a while since I've gone through this PDF of his and I'd say there's some. [Excuse me]. There's some areas for improvement in just the fact that this is a 38 page PowerPoint slide or PDF here.
Drew Giovannoli: If we're going to give you one page one slide one email. What are the critical things you want on that you think to secure meaning? What else would you like to see on the email that make it easy to forward on and get a meeting?
Amy Fletcher: The sales that we would see from or what we're doing today versus what we would be doing with them is always what I'm asked about. Any initiative that we want to implement, it has to be what's going to be the incremental sales from that? What's the cost? What are we going to see? So what's that? Return on investment.
Drew Giovannoli: Is all warehousing is done internally right now, right? Fulfillment and warehousing is all internal?
Amy Fletcher: Yes, it's all internal and we have an agency that helps us with some marketplace stuff but we still distribute our product to them to then do some FBA stuff with.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were CEO of ShipBob or had a product, is there anything that you would change to better serve a company like yours? What would you recommend to ShipBob if you were CEO for a day?
Amy Fletcher: They need to become more known. I don't think that I would have known ShipBob unless my counterpart had reached out to you guys.
Drew Giovannoli: Are you aware of other 3 PLs?
Amy Fletcher: Also a great question. No.
Drew Giovannoli: Where do you go to learn? Are you a part of any newsletters or do you go to any.
Amy Fletcher: The Veeqo thing is because of being on Amazon and then reaching out directly. But I don't know how ShipBob would partner with someone that's got a big voice to say unless they partnered with one of their, one of their customers. I don't know who's the biggest one. I do actually see a page in here that shows some of their customers and I'm not seeing any big names. I see Bloom. But.
Drew Giovannoli: You said Veeqo. Is that the agency that you work with?
Amy Fletcher: No, that's the Amazon Shipping Services. V, E E Q O.
Drew Giovannoli: And what's the agency you work with?
Amy Fletcher: It's Pattern.
Drew Giovannoli: And what do you use Pattern for?
Amy Fletcher: They're basically acting as the distribution partner for our Amazon for Swanson Health branded products. But Swanson Health sells Swanson Health branded products as well as partner brand products. So we've got the whole gambit. Garden of Life, Nature made, Nature's way. Solary.
Drew Giovannoli: How long have you been with Pattern?
Amy Fletcher: Just a little over a year.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you think they do really well.
Amy Fletcher: They have their own tech stack. Their company is super involved in just the future futuristic everything and being first to market and their proprietary tools and understanding the advertising metrics way better than any Amazon tool could do or understanding just the product market landscape. I mean they sell a whole bunch of VMS brands so that is one thing that's beneficial to us. Knowing that they already have all the experience in VMs so they know. But when it comes to shipping, I just don't know if that's as important. To know that you shipped a vitamins product. Can you ship ours? But I don't know is important.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything else that you'd love me to share with ShipBob either to make your life easier or things you could learn to improve?
Amy Fletcher: Do you know offhand what the main competitors are for ShipBob?
Drew Giovannoli: I mean there's a bunch of different three PL companies like a very long tail. ShipBob is kind of the. Has the most. Seems to have the most warehouses and be the most tech forward of the ones that are out there. I've been mostly focused on their business though so I wouldn't be able to give you a good outline of the competitive marketplace.
Amy Fletcher: Well, I guess that'd be interesting too to just know what, why you guys? Because our operations team might be having conversations with other ventures.

IVW-00228,ShipBob,Matt Mundt,Closed Lost,"An Interview with Matt Mundt, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Hug Sleep
Company Snapshot Hug Sleep is a small sleep products company headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, providing cocoon-style compression sleep pods and related accessories for adults and children across the United States, specializing in swaddle-inspired, deep pressure therapy products that promote relaxation and restful sleep without added weight.
Primer Matt evaluated ShipBob for 3PL services but they stopped responding after multiple calls and data submission.
Perspective ShipBob ghosted a multimillion-dollar prospect after multiple sales calls. Matt pays his current 3PL millions annually and went through the effort of multiple meetings with ShipBob, submitting detailed data they requested for pricing analysis in April. Despite the significant revenue opportunity, ShipBob never responded to follow-up emails, leaving the deal to die from lack of communication. For Hug Sleep, 3PL selection comes down to price above all else—a 10% savings translates to hundreds of thousands in annual cost reduction.
Pulse • Email abandonment — ShipBob stopped responding after data submission → lost multimillion-dollar annual contract opportunity
• Price-first evaluation — Hug Sleep prioritizes cost savings over software features → 10% reduction equals hundreds of thousands in savings
• Negative reputation — ShipBob has poor sentiment on DTC Twitter and personal networks → created skeptical starting position

Transcript
Q: How were you handling warehousing fulfillment before and what triggered you to look at 3PLs?
Matt Mundt: We were with a partner that we just were not satisfied with. Their pricing did not match what we were originally quoted or estimated. And there were some other issues as well, so that prompted us to look for a replacement.
Q: Was it mainly pricing or were there other operational issues you were unsatisfied with?
Matt Mundt: It was mainly pricing. I mean, there's always some other small things to nitpick, but for us with 3PLs, it's like 99% about price.
Q: What were your evaluation criteria, with price being number one?
Matt Mundt: I mean, they're so far down the list. But I mean, software, what cadence looks like. Communication, whether it's Slack integration or through email, those are all things that are positives. But they could all be not available features. But if the price is correct, we're going to go with that every time.
Q: Is there anything about what you're shipping or your industry that you were looking for specific industry expertise on?
Matt Mundt: No, no, we're very easy client for 3PLs.
Q: How did you go about finding 3PLs that you wanted to evaluate?
Matt Mundt: Through Google, through word of mouth, through network.
Q: What vendors did you eventually choose to evaluate?
Matt Mundt: I forget all of them. I can tell you who we're with now, which is WSI.
Q: What did WSI do really well?
Matt Mundt: Price.
Q: Where did ShipBob fall short versus WSI?
Matt Mundt: They stopped responding to my emails.
Q: Were they in the running to win the deal before communication stopped?
Matt Mundt: I don't know because they just never got me information. So I sent them over a document with a lot of data on it that they were gonna price out to see what the shipping costs would be and again, just all comes down to the numbers. If the numbers would have won, they would have got a pretty big contract.
Q: You started to engage with them, they asked for information to give you an accurate price, you provided that information, and then you never heard from them again?
Matt Mundt: Yep. And I went through multiple calls with them, which I very limited time, and then they just never responded.
Q: From the experience you did have with them before they stopped responding, did you have a positive or negative sentiment about ShipBob?
Matt Mundt: Neutral.
Q: Were you looking at where warehouses were located for pricing or delivery speed considerations?
Matt Mundt: I mean, shipping time does matter. There are options that we could go with currently with our current provider that would lower our price. But it might take five to seven days for a customer to get it, and that's too long for us. But a lot of these 3PLs have all converged where they're all using the same services. So it's just who's going to charge us the least amount?
Q: What had you heard about ShipBob that made it worth talking to them in the first place?
Matt Mundt: I mean, the reputation isn't positive, at least from what I've heard. But they were offering free AirPods if you could call. So I said, okay, AirPods.
Q: When you say the reputation wasn't positive, where did you learn about that from?
Matt Mundt: I mean, you can just type in ShipBob on X and go to DTC Twitter and see what people are saying and we have communicated with them in the past years and years and years ago. I think maybe they got us pricing and I think I would remember it being significantly higher than what we were paying at the time.
Q: What is going to DTC Twitter useful for? What can you learn from that?
Matt Mundt: It's just a community of people that live in the world of D2C, whether that's operators, agency founders, whatever the case may be. And everyone on the Internet's always willing to give out their 2 cents. So it's a very unfiltered take on the happenings within the community of D2C. So oftentimes people will share their unadulterated opinions. These are just strangers on the Internet, so you gotta take with a grain of salt. But I've also know people personally that have used ShipBob in the past that didn't have the greatest things to say. So it was a culmination of a lot of different sources that kind of led me to that opinion. But again, these are people that I don't know all that well. So let's take a call with them and see what they can do. And they stopped responding three months ago.
Q: You mentioned if they had responded with clear data and the right pricing, you probably would have switched. Can you clarify what you mean by clear data?
Matt Mundt: I think it's just transparency across the board. Whether communication style, the pricing, their promptness to respond to emails, all those things are taken into consideration.
Q: Do you feel like your business will actively look for the best prices and move to providers as opportunities present themselves, or will you stick with WSI if they deliver the right service at the current price?
Matt Mundt: We ship a lot of product, so if someone's able to come in and we're able to save 10% on average, that translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we would make the switch.
Q: If you were the CEO of ShipBob, what would you change to better serve a company like yours?
Matt Mundt: Respond to emails maybe? Top of the list. I mean, it's all about price. I mean, all these exciting young 3PLs go out and raise a lot of money and they talk about their software. No one gives a shit about the software. It's about the price. It all comes down to price and reliability. All the other stuff is just distraction.

IVW-00229,ShipBob,Hieu Nguyen,Closed Won,"An Interview with Brian Thomas, CEO at Completing the Puzzle
Company Snapshot Completing the Puzzle is a small consumer subscription service headquartered in Dallas, providing puzzle rental and delivery of high-quality jigsaw puzzles to consumers across the United States, specializing in eco-friendly, reusable packaging and a sustainable, circular rental model.
Primer Brian endured a six-month evaluation process with ShipBob only to receive pricing that violated his core transparency requirements.
Perspective Brian's evaluation lasted from January 8th to June 11th with no meaningful communication after April 23rd. His primary criterion was pricing transparency—pass-through rates with clear subscription fees rather than markup on shipping costs. After explicitly stating this requirement multiple times, ShipBob ultimately proposed the exact pricing structure he had rejected. The experience felt ""misleading"" and ""slimy"" when sales reps consistently justified rate markups by saying ""we have to make money""—identical responses that suggested scripted objections rather than genuine partnership discussions.
Pulse • Six-month timeline — evaluation from January to June with two-month silence → deal rejection and damaged relationship • Pricing transparency mandate — explicit request for pass-through rates → ShipBob proposed marked-up structure anyway
 • Scripted sales responses — three different reps used identical justifications for rate markups → undermined trust and partnership potential

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: What was your current solution at the time—your own warehouse, managing yourself?
Brian Thomas: Own warehouse, own software, own negotiated rates.
Drew Giovannoli: What prompted you to consider options outside of that?
Brian Thomas: We're at the point where I either need to open up other warehouses or find someone that has a 3PL network that I can like rent little spaces from to take advantage of like economies of scale shipping so we have enough volume where it start. It's making sense. It doesn't make sense for me to open up my own little warehouses, but it does make sense to rent little spaces cost efficient. And so it was like two parts that I was looking for was one was that. And the other thing was I spend a large majority of my time negotiating shipping rates and keeping the vendor relationships positive. It's a struggle. It's not actually something that I, I enjoy some of it and I enjoy the people, but it's also like it's a little taxing sometimes.
Drew Giovannoli: It's not why you started the business.
Brian Thomas: 100% exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually, that's probably the more fair description of it. Like, I don't know, I get wined and dined to places. Like I went to a UFC event. Like, I don't know. It's like, what's. If you're a UFC fan, it's like, that's part of the canvas. Yeah. It's front row seat. Row one. It was cool. Who took you EasyPost. Yeah. And so if you're a UFC fan, Uriah Faber sat behind me. So that was like dope. Yeah, it was like that made my experience, but it also opened my eyes where it's like, there's a lot of money in this, so maybe if I can get someone that's not going to take me front row and give me a little bit better rates. Let's see. And yeah, so I was looking for someone to take all that off because as cool as that is, like, it's not really what I started it for.
Drew Giovannoli: How did you source vendors and what was your evaluation criteria?
Brian Thomas: How did I source them? Going to events. Events. Google. Asking friends. So I'm in a mastermind with 24. There's 25 of us in this mastermind. I ask them, go to events like Sub Summit, Shop Talk and like Pack Expo. All the packing stuff. And then googling and just seeing like competitive analysis. Just like ShipHero versus. And then ShipBob's gonna come up. Yeah, ShipHero. ShipEasy versus. And it'll pop up with ShipBob or something like that. And I'm tangentially friends with like a C suite or a founder of ShipBob. I forget who and who the friend is. But that was, I think that was. I think that person's in the mastermind. And that was the original, like intro.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you have a set of criteria going in?
Brian Thomas: Yeah, like the, the main thing was it was if you're going to charge a subscription fee and fees on top, do that. And don't charge me on rates or charge me on rates. I don't want. I don't want this double dipping because then I'm just going to. I'm going to feel taken advantage of and I just, I'd rather just have it be super transparent and I'd rather just get your pass through rates and then you just charge me what you want to make. Just so I can feel like we're actually having a partner and relationship versus like me always second guessing, like, are they overcharging me? What's going on here? Was number one.
Drew Giovannoli: What would be the other criteria?
Brian Thomas: I think that's, that's number one. And the rest came down to like, did I like them? Was it efficient? Like did they. Were they going to have as little errors as possible? So when I think about shipping, I think there, there are three legs. Price, speed, and quality for returns. I don't care about speed because I can always float the inventory. So I want it to be low price and high quality. And if it's super, super slow, great. Like that's like the ideal scenario.
Drew Giovannoli: Were there specific needs or use case or industry requirements you were looking for?
Brian Thomas: Nope.
Drew Giovannoli: What vendors did you look at?
Brian Thomas: Some I don't want to share the ones I will share Worldwide Express and then the rest are just kind of one offs to be honest. Like regional 3PLs. So piecing together this like the puzzle of return shipping. So using different regional people to like someone to handle LA, someone to handle Atlanta, someone to handle Chicago and then Pennsylvania ish area.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you end up choosing another vendor in the process?
Brian Thomas: There's actually one, a competitor to ShipBob that is gonna do. Honestly gonna do everything I wanted ShipBob to do. They're passing through the rates. They're. We have like a per label markup and then we have a flat subscription fee and they're passing through the rates 100%. And they were actually like super transparent. They're like, these are the rates. And I was like, yeah, I know. Like, I can like, they, they sent me more than enough and I, I've now talked to enough vendors where I know that they're. They're not marking it up. So yeah, great.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you think the biggest gap that ShipBob failed to meet your expectations or weaknesses or reasons why you didn't go with them?
Brian Thomas: It's honestly the people, because the. I've talked to ShipBob two or three times now, and I kind of have the exact same conversation that I have with everyone where I'm like, don't upcharge me on the rates. Just charge me like your. I want to know what your margin is. Because I want to have a relationship and a partnership and that's what I view it is. And if you don't want to, that's fine, but if you want to, we can keep going down the road. And they're like, okay. And then ShipBob is the slowest to get back to me. And at the end they end up marking up the rates and charging a subscription fee. And I'm like, you're just wasting my time. And it's just. It was frustrating. So it's just the people, like I say like, hey, don't, don't touch the red button. And then they're like, we won't. And then two months later they just like press the button and you're just like, oh, this is just disappointing from a humanity moral standpoint, to be honest.
Drew Giovannoli: How long did it take you to receive pricing from ShipBob?
Brian Thomas: They're like probably the longest. April 23rd to July 11th. And just to get a no. No, no. And so the whole. This most recent conversation started early February. So it took February until June 11th. Let's see the earliest. Oh, man. Yeah, I, I can't off the top of my head find or just in this moment find the first conversation, but the earliest email that I can see. Oh, January. Nope. Oh, it is January 8th. So we talked from January 8th. Gathered data, went back and forth until April 23rd. Yeah, April 23rd. And then from April 23rd I just sat waiting. And then June 11th I got a rejection that they weren't going to be able to do it a long time. That's six months. It's crazy.
Drew Giovannoli: How long did the competitors take?
Brian Thomas: The longest one is they just actually sent it today. Three weeks. He just sent it today. So I will, I can pull it up. June 4th to July 3rd, that was the longest. So 29 days. Correct. Yeah. The normal turnaround time is like two and a half, three weeks. The only land actually will give the people that just responded today a pass because in the middle of it there was a most recently rate increase. So it caused like some back and forth. They were, they communicated that. So the expectation was that like it didn't go the 29 days without communication like with ShipBob with these guys, they preemptively reached out and said like, hey, as you know, industry changes and we're. It's taking a little longer. With ShipBob, it was just nothing.
Drew Giovannoli: What was the experience like from January to April in terms of pricing and sales?
Brian Thomas: At the time it was fine and it was actually seemed really productive. And then at the end it just seemed misleading because it ended up being. It was disappointing in the end because it was overcharging on the rates, charges a subscription fee, which I asked not to do. And then when I pushed back, it was from whatever dates I told you, just silence. And then a rejection like, I don't know, it doesn't take that long to know that you don't want to do it.
Drew Giovannoli: If they had matched the pricing you needed in the format, would they have won the deal?
Brian Thomas: Yep. I think out of the gate. So I had a bad experience, a very similar experience like two years ago with them. Let's say all that experience is down, and it's just like starting fresh with ShipBob. It's called ShipBob 2. And it was the exact same software and everything probably. I mean, they were. Their. Their software and locations and everything else seemed awesome. It was just. It's honestly just people.
Drew Giovannoli: When you say people, was there a bad experience one to one with the person on the phone also?
Brian Thomas: Yeah, the first person. The I talked with the first person, like, organically, and then the next person I talked with at Sub Summit, and then this last person, they all said this exact same thing, which makes me feel like it's like a trained thing or learned when I push back on, why are you marking up the postage? They say, because we have to make money. All three of them said the exact same thing. And I was like, that's fine. But I started every conversation saying that I wanted you to be transparent with how much money you want to make. And they're just like, we're not telling you we have to make money. And it's just like it was the slimiest feeling.
Drew Giovannoli: Can you expand upon what you think they did well?
Brian Thomas: I think their tech's pretty interesting, the way that they digitized the warehouse. They would spend time understanding our layout, giving us guidance on the layout. The API looked pretty dope, honestly. Like, probably one of the better APIs that I've seen. Like, from a tech perspective, I was pretty excited to integrate with their software from a logistics perspective. I visited their warehouse in Dallas and it seemed pretty like, is a clean warehouse cleaner than this other one? I went today, and yeah, logistically and software wise, they seem to have it down.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of ShipBob, what would you do to better serve companies like yours?
Brian Thomas: Preemptively. Give, like, a timeline of, like, rough outline of, like, how long things should take. Because it was just a really long time without any notification and like, there was no expectation. Yeah, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that the other vendors did that ShipBob would benefit from hearing?
Brian Thomas: The. The tickets to the match, it was actually like, to me, it's actually a negative. Like, I'll do it all day long, but then I'm just like, oh, you're like, making more money. Like, a dinner is fine. Or like, honestly, the thing that does it for me is buying my employees, bringing coffee for the employees, coffee and donuts for the employees. I can do what I want. Like, I don't. If I wanted to go to the UFC, I could probably just pay for myself. Now it's cool if someone's paying for it, but what matters more to me is, like, the employees and them feeling like they get something. Yeah, the. The thing that the. The other vendors that I liked and the one that I'm going with, they were. They didn't waste time on the calls in a long, drawn out presentation. Like, I used to work for Booz Allen and it was like, very corporate, like, doing consulting, and we would do 20 page slideshows that were like, this is like, the benefits of working with Booz Allen and all this stuff. And I'm like, okay. Like, it doesn't really do much for me. And like, there was a lot of that with ShipBob, and I was just like, like, I get that ShipBob's proud of ShipBob, but ShipBob didn't seem proud to work with me. And all the other vendors, like, literally had like one or no slides about themselves and then jumped immediately into me. And it just didn't waste time either. So I had a call with the one today and we spent. It was a 30 minute call. We spent the last 15 minutes like talking about our dogs because they just got right to it versus ShipBob's the best. So yeah.
