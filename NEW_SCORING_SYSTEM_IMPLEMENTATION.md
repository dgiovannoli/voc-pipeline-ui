# New Separated Relevance/Sentiment Scoring System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the new separated relevance/intensity and sentiment scoring system, replacing the previous combined 0-5 scale that tried to encode both importance and sentiment in a single number.

## Problem Solved

**Previous System Issues:**
- 0-5 scale tried to encode both relevance/importance AND sentiment
- Confusing interpretation: Is a 4 always bad? Is a 5 always good?
- Hard to distinguish between "highly relevant negative feedback" and "highly relevant positive feedback"
- Limited analytical flexibility

**New System Benefits:**
- **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Flexibility**: Can analyze relevance and sentiment independently
- **Better Analytics**: Track trends in relevance and sentiment separately
- **Improved Insights**: Distinguish between deal-breakers and deal-winners

## New Scoring System

### Relevance/Intensity Score (0-5)
- **0**: Not relevant/not mentioned (omit from scores)
- **1**: Slight mention
- **2**: Clear mention
- **3**: Strong mention
- **4**: Very strong mention
- **5**: Highest possible relevance/intensity

### Sentiment/Polarity (separate field)
- **positive**: Generally favorable, satisfied, enthusiastic, praise
- **negative**: Dissatisfied, frustrated, critical, complaints
- **neutral**: Balanced, factual, neither positive nor negative
- **mixed**: Contains both positive and negative elements

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`update_scoring_schema.sql`)

```sql
-- Add new sentiment column
ALTER TABLE quote_analysis ADD COLUMN sentiment VARCHAR CHECK (sentiment IN ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral', 'mixed'));

-- Rename existing score column to relevance_score for clarity
ALTER TABLE quote_analysis RENAME COLUMN score TO relevance_score;

-- Add computed columns for easy filtering
ALTER TABLE quote_analysis ADD COLUMN is_high_relevance BOOLEAN GENERATED ALWAYS AS (relevance_score >= 4) STORED;
ALTER TABLE quote_analysis ADD COLUMN is_deal_impacting BOOLEAN GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    (relevance_score >= 4 AND sentiment = 'negative') OR 
    (relevance_score >= 4 AND sentiment = 'positive')
) STORED;
```

### 2. Stage 2 Analyzer Updates (`enhanced_stage2_analyzer.py`)

**Prompt Updates:**
- Updated scoring instructions to separate relevance from sentiment
- Modified output format to include separate `sentiments` field
- Updated scoring examples to show the new approach

**Function Updates:**
- Updated `save_analysis_to_supabase()` to handle sentiment data
- Modified function calls to pass sentiment information

### 3. Database Save Function Updates (`supabase_database.py`)

**Updated `save_quote_analysis()`:**
- Maps 'score' to 'relevance_score' for backward compatibility
- Adds sentiment field to saved data
- Handles the new column structure

### 4. UI Display Updates (`app.py`)

**Quote Display:**
- Shows relevance score (0-5) as a number
- Displays sentiment with color-coded icons:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Positive
  - ðŸ”´ Negative
  - ðŸŸ¡ Mixed
  - âšª Neutral
- Improved readability and interpretation

### 5. Stage 4 Theme Generation Updates (`stage4_theme_analyzer.py`)

**Quote Collection:**
- Updated to include relevance scores and sentiment in quote objects
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing impact scores
- Prepares for future Stage 2 reprocessing

## Usage Examples

### Before (Old System)
```
Question: "How do you evaluate pricing?"
Response: "pricing is reasonable"
Score: 2 (unclear if this is positive or just relevant)
```

### After (New System)
```
Question: "How do you evaluate pricing?"
Response: "pricing is reasonable"
Relevance Score: 2 (clear mention)
Sentiment: positive (favorable)
```

### UI Display
```
- pricing is reasonable
  Relevance: 2.0/5 | ðŸŸ¢ Positive
```

## Business Logic Applications

### Strengths Identification
- **High Relevance + Positive Sentiment** = Major strength
- Example: Relevance 5, Positive = "Deal-winning strength"

### Risk Identification
- **High Relevance + Negative Sentiment** = Critical issue
- Example: Relevance 5, Negative = "Deal-breaker, must fix"

### Monitoring Areas
- **Moderate Relevance, Any Sentiment** = Monitor closely
- Example: Relevance 3, Neutral = "Important but not polarizing"

### Low Priority
- **Low Relevance** = Can be ignored
- Example: Relevance 1, Negative = "Minor complaint"

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Schema Update âœ…
- Run `update_scoring_schema.sql` to update database
- Existing data gets default sentiment values

### Phase 2: Code Updates âœ…
- Update Stage 2 analyzer prompts and logic
- Update UI display
- Update Stage 4 theme generation

### Phase 3: Data Reprocessing (Recommended)
- Reprocess Stage 2 data to get proper relevance/sentiment scores
- Regenerate Stage 4 themes with new scoring data

### Phase 4: Validation
- Run `test_new_scoring_system.py` to verify implementation
- Check UI display and data consistency

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:

```bash
python test_new_scoring_system.py
```

This will test:
1. Database schema updates
2. Stage 2 analyzer functionality
3. UI display format
4. Stage 4 theme generation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clearer Interpretation**: Users know exactly what each number means
2. **Better Analytics**: Can track relevance and sentiment trends separately
3. **Improved Insights**: Distinguish between deal-breakers and deal-winners
4. **Enhanced Filtering**: Easy to find "high relevance negative feedback" or "high relevance positive feedback"
5. **Better Decision Making**: More actionable insights for business strategy

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sentiment Confidence**: Add confidence scores for sentiment classification
2. **Sentiment Intensity**: Add intensity levels (very positive, slightly positive, etc.)
3. **Context-Aware Sentiment**: Consider question context when determining sentiment
4. **Automated Insights**: Generate insights based on relevance/sentiment patterns
