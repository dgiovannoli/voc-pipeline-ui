        I think I'm the only one that's really using it right now, so I wouldn't say it's for the firm yet. 
        I've been using it and to test it out and see if it's something that I should push to have more widespread adoption. 
        But part of it for me is that historically, either we need to find a vendor who we send files to, and then they do human transcription services, and it takes time. 
        It's expensive. And I would rather, while doing an investigation, upload a series of videos, audio files, and then within minutes, have audio transcription, an actual transcript ready. 
        And have it mostly be. I mean, accuracy is important with this. So every time I've used it, I've needed to go through and edit, do some extensive editing. 
        Because we need as faithful a recreation as possible. Faithful transcription as possible. So yeah. I think it's the speed and expense that really turned me on to it. 
        Yeah, it lets me just get work done in a more timely manner instead of waiting and then checking emails with some other service and be like, is it ready yet? It's frustrating.
