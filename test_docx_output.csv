Unknown_Unknown_1_1,"I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was with court reporters. Sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be a hundred percent perfect, just something that I can refer to, or also to have something to refer to in real time. If there's multiple parties and there's a lot of crosstalk going on, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it, I want to just be able to look up and say, oh yeah, it was 1 46 0.5 or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page.",Product Usage,How have you used Rev so far?,closed_won,Vandenberg Law Firm,Alex,2024-01-01,
Unknown_Unknown_1_2,"I started with the, let me see, what was the name of the company? It'll come to me, but it was also one of those online recording and transcription websites. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping basically pretty much everything. So then I thought, there's got to be a better solution, but it's got to be something more accurate. And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more geared towards legal field rather than just general recording. So I thought, Hey, that's perfect. And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes, like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X 20 minutes well within what I need.",Product Discovery,How did you come across Rev and what made you choose it?,closed_won,Vandenberg Law Firm,Alex,2024-01-01,

Unknown_Unknown_2_2,"I've recently noticed that when I'm, because it says that I can record even when I'm offline, but it doesn't give me a transcript, it only gives me the voice, the sound wave. So the other day I was working remotely out of a client's office and his wifi was down, so we were using the hotspot off my phone, which wasn't really great for deposition. So to save on bandwidth, we just shut everything off and we just both used my laptop and we had a Zoom video depo, so I didn't connect my iPad to save some bandwidth. And the only thing I could get is the sound wave. Now I know I recorded it and then later it transcribed it. But it would've been helpful since it's just using the voice coming out of my speakers if it could still write it out as we go.",Product Features,What limitations have you encountered with the offline recording feature on Rev?,closed_won,Unknown,Unknown,2024-01-01,

So I'm wondering if there is a way, if maybe I didn't read the instructions or if there's something that can be built later on, if there is a way to connect it so that it records and takes the audio directly from within the Zoom meeting instead of me playing it out loud through speakers and it picking up the sound coming out of my speakers. Yeah. Because that also degrades the quality a bit.

Unknown_Unknown_3_2,"I'm curious, what other tools do you use, like case management software or anything else that's going to in your. Yeah, so it depends on what I would law firm associating with at the moment. But for case management, I've used File Vine, actually that's the more prevalent one on my last three clients over the last year and a half. They've all set me up on file line within their infrastructures for if I work on the defense side. So I do, lemme back up. I do personal injury. So I've done plaintiff's side, now I'm focusing more on working with defense firms. They would set me up with juries for their billing, for me to put in my hours. So I'm based on what I work on As far as case management, like I said, file one's been the predominant one here at the current client, they just use, they're pretty simple. I mean, I don't want to simplify it like that, but they just use Google Drive or not Google Drive, Microsoft, what do you call it? The. Word. File storage, like the fdr. What's the Microsoft version of G Drive? It's the SharePoint. SharePoint, yeah. There you go.

Unknown_Unknown_4_2,"Also, I was wondering on the subject of improvement, since I thought Rev was supposed to be a little more legal oriented, I noticed that it has sometimes a hard time picking up specific legal jargon, and I thought maybe there could be some sort of dictionary included within, so that it's picking up words that sound like it are more like this, for example. Lemme see, that was a, oh yeah, somebody raised an objection, asked and answered, and I see the transcription says asset and asset, and I'm thinking, well, basic objections, vague, argumentative, asked and answered should be built in so that the system knows when something like that.

Unknown_Unknown_5_1,"I needed a real life transcript that runs along as people are speaking. There are tools that record, and then you upload it and then they give you a transcript. But I wanted something that's real, that's running in real time that I can just look over and like I said, I can scroll 10 lines ahead to see what was the word I missed? Something that's more accurate in picking up what's being said so that I don't have to spend hours correcting every single word from not just people's names, but everyday sentences. And I like that it had separate app that I don't have to, because if I have my Zoom on full screen, it's hard for me to tab over. So I like that I can just have it on an app separately, and I prefer running it on my iPad rather than having it on my laptop in the background. And then notification comes in and it might affect things like you did with the prior one. So yeah, those were, and also I wanted as little limitations as possible because I've had depos that went for 30 minutes and I've had depos that went for five hours and up. Now, those don't happen often, but I need to be able to capture the whole thing. So a generous budget of minutes, or not a timer lockout, like some free packages due is also something that was important to me. And I don't mind paying for it. Of course, within reason, if it's 30 bucks a month, that's something different, and it's 300 bucks a month. So yeah, 30 bucks a month is fine.

Unknown_Unknown_5_2,"The Yeah, I would download it. I would download, let's say the word version, and then it highlights, its speaker one, speaker two, speaker three. So then I would just change the names to whoever was speaking at that time. Oh, that was also another thing that was a little bit frustrating. While I see the transcript running, it just gives me timestamps, but it doesn't break it up into different speakers. So while it's running, it says one hour 52 53 seconds, one hour, 52 54 seconds, and it goes line by line, but it doesn't separate it into speakers until the transcript's fully uploaded, generated and downloaded, which was something that the, and again, I'll remember the name the previous site was doing, except their audio picking up system was horrible, but it was nice where I could see speaker one, or if I put in the name Drew, and then paragraph from you and then Alex, and then sentences from me and then back to Drew.",Workflow Optimization,"When you finish with the transcript, what do you do with it?",closed_won,Unknown,Unknown,2024-01-01,

Now I know a lot of people use their favorite court reporting agency, and then, but it ends up mostly on Zoom. So if there was a button on Zoom, just like you have record button, if there was a plugin, you can install a rev button that gives you the ability to run a transcript, that would be helpful.

So if I could maybe set up categories or maybe tell the summary to look out for these four issue areas or however many there may be for a specific attorney's preference, if I could teach it. Now, when you're writing me the summary, tell me about the person's prior accidents or prior injuries, history, whatever was said. Tell me about medical treatment. Look for keywords of doctor this, doctor that, and summarize medical treatment. I don't know if that's too specific or if I can put in keywords, search for the keywords accident and highlight everything that the guy said with the word accident. Although accident might be too general, but let's say I go through the guy's medical records and there is Dr. Smith, and then I would just put in a prompt saying, highlight everything about Dr. Smith that's being said or pointed out in the summary.",Workflow Optimization,What additional functionality would you find useful beyond the transcript when using Rev for depositions?,closed_won,Unknown,Unknown,2024-01-01,
