I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, sometimes it's not you have a microphone."

A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind?

But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing.

Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us?
