I'll ask you questions and no bias, anything positive, anything negative is on the table, but do you want your permission to record it privately only for their use?","Customer Feedback","Customer Interview Permission","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Insightful customer feedback gathering approach","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_1","Enhanced AI Feature for Legal Professionals","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","Product Features","How do you use Rev today and what specific triggers or keywords do you look for?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Positive feedback on Rev's AI feature for legal professionals","Improved efficiency in reviewing transcripts and recordings, ability to quickly access specific information","Satisfied with the ease of use and functionality of the AI feature","No significant risks or concerns mentioned","Rev's AI feature stands out for its ability to assist in legal case preparation and analysis","Highly satisfied with the product's performance and impact on legal work","Positive feedback on the AI feature's usefulness and potential for further enhancements","Satisfied with the quality of service provided by Rev","AI feature, ease of use, and specific legal functionalities were key decision factors","Previous transcription service was time-consuming and expensive, lacked specific legal features","Increased efficiency in reviewing legal materials, improved accuracy in case preparation","Interest in further integration of legal terms and customization options for the AI feature"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_2","Potential for Customized AI Learning and Integration","I think it's exactly the type of feedback they're looking for, they're going to be excited about this type of conversation. In this interview in particular, you mentioned consent as an example and a bunch of Consent to search for instance card. I was wondering if you at a high level could identify a couple of different use cases, how you use today and specifics and what those types of triggers or keywords or things you'd be looking for? I think they'd love to hear that feedback.","Integration","Identify different use cases and triggers for Rev's AI feature","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Interest in customized AI learning and integration for specific legal use cases","Potential for enhanced AI functionality tailored to legal professionals' needs","Openness to providing detailed use cases and triggers for AI customization","No specific risks or concerns mentioned","Customized AI learning and integration could differentiate Rev in the legal market","Enthusiastic about the possibility of enhancing Rev's AI for legal applications","Interest in providing feedback on specific use cases and triggers for AI improvement","Satisfied with the quality of service provided by Rev","Customization potential and AI integration capabilities are key decision factors","Desire for more tailored AI functionality for legal analysis and case preparation","Anticipated improvements in efficiency and accuracy with customized AI learning","Looking forward to contributing to the development of Rev's AI feature for legal professionals"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_1","Integration Requirements for Legal Research Platforms","Yeah, I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind? Things that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms.","Integration","Integration requirements for legal research platforms","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Discussing integration needs for legal research platforms like Westlaw or LexiNexis","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_2","Depth of Evidence Analysis for Legal Cases","Really good question. I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidence, if that makes sense.","Decision Making","Factors influencing depth of evidence analysis in legal cases","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Exploring the importance of evidence volume in legal case analysis","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_4_2","Value of AI in handling high-volume cases","I think that equally, I mean, I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. Right. they probably get more bang for their buck that way.","AI Value in High-Volume Cases","Where can AI like Rev provide the most value in legal cases?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Insight into the value of AI in handling high-volume legal cases efficiently","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Rev could improve accuracy and technology for better transcription quality","I think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, sometimes it's not you have a microphone. Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good.","Product Improvement","Areas for improvement in Rev's transcription service","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Accuracy and technology improvements needed for transcription quality","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"Rev_LeilaVaezIravani_6_1","Improvements in Voice Recognition Technology and Speaker Distinction","I did notice last time there's quite a few errors I think that I didn't do the human, I think there's one that you can get humans to look it over. I think they just need to crisp it up a little bit. Voice recognition technology or whatever they use. There was a quite a bit of error. Also the distinction between speakers. Sometimes there was two speakers. I thought there was three. again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is.

"Rev_LeilaVaezIravani_6_2","AI-Powered Client Intake and Evidence Analysis","I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I don't dunno how big of a margin that would really improve my day to day. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful.","Process Improvement","Suggestions for enhancing Rev's services and functionalities","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Opportunities for AI-powered client intake and evidence analysis","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_9_1","Importance of Speed and Accuracy in Transcription Services","I think speed is the most important because when you want something, if you need it, you need it. I think accuracy has to be number two because if it's not accurate, then who cares? It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it comfortably enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct.
