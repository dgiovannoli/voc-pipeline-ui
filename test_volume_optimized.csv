"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_1","Enhanced AI Feature for Legal Transcription","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","Product Features","How do you currently use the AI feature in Rev and what specific improvements or integrations would enhance your experience?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Positive feedback on Rev's AI feature for legal transcription and suggestions for further enhancements","Improved efficiency in reviewing transcripts and identifying key information for legal cases","Satisfied with the current AI capabilities but sees potential for integrating legal terms and enhancing learning capabilities","No specific risks mentioned in relation to the AI feature","Rev's AI feature stands out for its ability to provide quick insights and streamline the review process for legal professionals","Highly satisfied with the AI feature's functionality and sees value in recommending it to other lawyers","Positive feedback on the AI feature's usefulness in legal transcription and desire for further customization options","AI feature is perceived as highly beneficial and impactful in improving workflow efficiency for legal tasks","The AI feature's ability to enhance productivity and streamline the review process is a key factor in recommending Rev to other legal professionals","No significant pain points mentioned, indicating a positive user experience with the AI feature","Increased efficiency in reviewing transcripts, quicker identification of key information, and potential for further customization and integration with legal terms","Interest in continued use of Rev's AI feature and potential for enhancements to align with specific legal requirements"

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_1","Enhancing Legal Discovery Process with AI Analysis","Yeah, I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind? Things that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing. Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.","Legal Discovery Process Enhancement","How could AI technology improve legal discovery processes?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","AI technology can significantly enhance legal discovery processes by automating the analysis of large volumes of evidence, improving efficiency, and providing valuable insights for lawyers.","Time-saving, efficient analysis of discovery materials, improved case preparation, and enhanced decision-making based on AI-generated insights.","AI integration could streamline the discovery process, reduce manual labor, and offer a more comprehensive analysis of evidence for legal professionals.","Potential risks include data privacy concerns, accuracy of AI analysis, and the need for proper training to utilize AI tools effectively in legal settings.","Implementing AI technology for legal discovery can position Buried Wins as an innovative and efficient solution provider in the legal industry.","Enhanced legal research capabilities, improved case outcomes, and increased efficiency in handling large volumes of evidence for clients.","Positive feedback on the potential benefits of AI-driven legal discovery tools, with a focus on time-saving features and improved analysis capabilities.","AI integration could enhance the quality of legal services by offering more accurate and comprehensive analysis of evidence, leading to better outcomes for clients.","Key decision factors include the cost-effectiveness of AI implementation, the level of automation provided, and the potential impact on legal professionals' workflow.","Current pain points in legal discovery, such as manual data analysis, time-consuming document searches, and inefficient evidence review processes, could be addressed through AI technology.","Success metrics for AI integration in legal discovery may include time saved on evidence analysis, improved case preparation efficiency, and client satisfaction with outcomes.","Future plans may involve expanding AI capabilities for legal research, developing customized tools for specific legal domains, and enhancing collaboration with legal professionals for feedback and improvement."
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_2","Differentiating Legal Cases Based on Evidence Volume and Importance","Really good question. I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidence, if that makes sense.","Legal Case Differentiation Based on Evidence","How do you differentiate between serious and less serious legal cases based on evidence?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Legal professionals differentiate between serious and less serious cases based on the volume and importance of evidence, focusing efforts on cases with higher stakes and significant evidence.","Efficient allocation of resources, improved case strategy, and better client outcomes by prioritizing cases with substantial evidence and potential impact.","Experience-based decision-making in legal case management, balancing the level of evidence with the expected outcomes and client needs for effective legal representation.","Risks include overlooking critical evidence in less serious cases, potential misjudgment of case importance based solely on evidence volume, and the need for careful evaluation of case priorities.","Buried Wins can offer tailored legal services by understanding the nuances of case differentiation and providing strategic advice based on evidence analysis and case significance.","Clients benefit from focused legal representation, efficient case handling, and tailored strategies based on the differentiation of cases according to evidence volume and importance.","Positive feedback on the personalized approach to legal case management, highlighting the importance of evidence analysis and strategic decision-making in legal representation.","Enhanced service quality through targeted case management, efficient resource allocation, and client-centric strategies based on evidence differentiation for optimal outcomes.","Key decision factors include evidence assessment, case prioritization based on importance, resource allocation efficiency, and client expectations for successful legal representation.","Challenges in legal case management include balancing evidence volume with case significance, ensuring thorough analysis of critical evidence, and aligning case strategies with client needs.","Success metrics may include client satisfaction with case outcomes, efficient resource utilization, improved case resolution times, and positive feedback on tailored legal strategies.","Future plans may involve refining case differentiation processes, enhancing evidence analysis tools, and developing customized legal services based on evidence volume and case importance for continued client success."

However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle.

"Rev_LeilaVaezIravani_5_1","Improvement in Voice Recognition Technology and Speaker Distinction","I think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, sometimes it's not you have a microphone.

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_6_1","Enhancing client intake process through AI capabilities","I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I don't know how big of a margin that would really improve my day to day.

I could use it in a hearing. that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more. Yes.
