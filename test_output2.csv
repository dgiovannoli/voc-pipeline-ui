"TestCompany2_TestInterviewee2_2","Rev's AI feature has significantly improved the user experience for legal professionals by providing quick access to specific interview segments and generating bullet points for easier review. The integration of legal terms and the ability to educate the AI on specific criteria would further enhance its utility.","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","Product Features","How do you use Rev today and what specific triggers or keywords do you look for?","closed won","Test Company 2","Test Interviewee 2","01/15/2024","Rev's AI feature significantly enhances user experience by providing quick access to specific interview segments and generating bullet points for easier review.","Improved efficiency in reviewing transcripts and identifying key information in legal cases.","Integration of legal terms and AI education features would further enhance the user experience.","N/A","N/A","N/A","Positive feedback on the AI feature's usefulness in legal cases.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"TestCompany2_TestInterviewee2_3","The key insight from this chunk is the potential for AI tools to streamline legal processes, specifically in analyzing evidence and discovery in legal cases. The interviewee highlights the importance of tools that can efficiently search through large volumes of evidence, such as transcripts or discovery documents, to find specific information relevant to the case. This not only saves time for lawyers but also enhances the quality of legal representation by allowing them to focus on cases with higher stakes and more complex evidence.","Yeah, I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind? Things that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing. Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.","Legal Process Optimization","How can AI tools improve legal processes and streamline evidence analysis in legal cases?","closed won","Test Company 2","Test Interviewee 2","01/15/2024","AI tools can significantly enhance legal processes by efficiently analyzing evidence and discovery documents, saving time for lawyers and improving the quality of legal representation.","Time-saving, improved legal outcomes","AI tools could be integrated to search for specific legal terms and analyze large volumes of evidence, potentially through collaboration with existing legal research platforms.","Potential challenges in AI implementation could include data privacy concerns and the need for technical expertise.","Adopting AI tools for evidence analysis can provide a competitive edge by enhancing legal research capabilities and improving case outcomes.","Efficient evidence analysis and discovery can lead to better legal representation, client satisfaction, and successful case outcomes.","Positive feedback on the potential benefits of AI tools for legal processes and evidence analysis.","AI tools can enhance the quality and efficiency of legal services by streamlining evidence analysis and discovery processes.","The decision to implement AI tools in legal practice is driven by the need for time-saving solutions, improved case outcomes, and enhanced legal research capabilities.","Challenges in evidence analysis, discovery, and case preparation can be addressed through the adoption of AI tools.","Success in implementing AI tools can be measured by time saved in evidence analysis, improved case outcomes, and client satisfaction.","Future plans may involve further integration of AI tools for legal research, evidence analysis, and discovery processes."
"TestCompany2_TestInterviewee2_4","The decision to use AI tools like Rev in legal cases is influenced by the volume and seriousness of evidence, with more serious cases requiring deeper analysis. However, even in less serious cases, the focus may shift to mitigation strategies rather than evidence examination. Rev's value lies in its ability to assist in both high-stakes cases with extensive evidence and more common cases like DUIs and domestic violence, where repetitive patterns can be identified and addressed efficiently.","I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidenced, if that makes sense. It's a combination. serious would be, when I say serious case, sorry. Yeah, penalty. I mean the typical way is felony misdemeanor, but it depends what it is. A felony theft charge, you could argue it's less serious than a misdemeanor domestic violence charge on your record. Right? generally, yes. I look at the time, the exposure, if it's a felony, if it's a misdemeanor. Also the nature of the crime, is it just a drug offense? Is it a property offense or is it an offense where there's a tangible victim, violent offenses, anything sexual in nature, which I usually don't touch, those are inherently more serious. To an extent? To an extent it's one of those, yes, to an extent. To an extent. When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case. However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence. I think that equally, I mean, I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. Right. they probably get more bang for their buck that way.","AI Tools in Legal Cases","How does the seriousness of legal cases influence the use of AI tools like Rev?","closed won","Test Company 2","Test Interviewee 2","01/15/2024","AI tools like Rev are valuable in both high-stakes cases with extensive evidence and more common cases like DUIs and domestic violence, where repetitive patterns can be identified and addressed efficiently.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is.

And I think that it would take the old school lawyers that are used to just sending it to a person would convince them to jump over. Another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through.
