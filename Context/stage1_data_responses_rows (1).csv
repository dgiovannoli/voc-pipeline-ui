Vandenberglawfirm_Alex Vandenberg_4_1,"So I needed a real-time transcript that runs along as people are speaking. There are tools that record and then you upload it and then they give you a transcript. But I wanted something that's real, that's running in real time that I can just look over and, like I said, I can scroll 10 lines ahead to see what was the word I missed. Something that's more accurate in picking up what's being said so that I don't have to spend hours correcting every single word from not just people's names, but everyday sentences. And I like that it had a separate app that I don't have to... 'Cause if I have my Zoom on full screen, it's hard for me to tab over. So it's, I like that I can just have it on an app separately and I prefer running it on my iPad rather than having it on my laptop in the background. And then, you know, notification comes in and it might affect things like it did with the prior one. So yeah, those were... And also, I wanted as little limitations as possible because I've had depos that went for 30 minutes and I've had depos that went for five hours and up. Now those, they don't happen often, but I need to be able to capture the whole thing. So, a generous budget of minutes, or not a timer lockout like some like free packages do is also something that was important to me. And I don't mind paying for it, of course within reason. If it's 30 bucks a month that's something different than it's 300 bucks a month. So yeah, 30 bucks a month is fine.

Vandenberglawfirm_Alex Vandenberg_6_2,"Maybe if it's, like for example, specifically for me, when I'm dealing with personal injury. Usually the depositions get broken up into several categories. The person's background, the accident itself, the medical treatment, and their life afterwards. Whether it's for most parties and for most types of accidents. Whether it's somebody slipping at Target or somebody being pancaked by an 18-wheeler, it's the same procedure. So, if I could maybe set up categories, or maybe tell the summary to look out for these four issue areas. Or however many there may be for a specific attorney's preference. If I could teach it, you know, when you're doing me... When you're writing me the summary. ""Tell me about the person's prior accidents or prior injuries, history, whatever was said. Tell me about medical treatment. Like, look for keywords of doctor this, doctor that. And summarize medical treatment."" Like, I don't know if that's too specific? Or if I can put in keywords. Search for the keywords accident, then highlight everything that the guy said with the word ""accident"". Although, accident might be too general. But let's say I go through the guy's medical records and there is Dr. Smith. And then I would just put in a prompt saying, ""Highlight everything about Dr. Smith that's being said."" Or point it out in the summary. Let's say Dr. Smith performed a surgery that I'm arguing was not necessary. And plaintiff's attorney says it's absolutely necessary. And we might be going back and forth several times over what Dr. Smith did or didn't do. So, kind of, instead of me downloading the transcript and then control F and trying to figure it out.

Vandenberglawfirm_Alex Vandenberg_1_1,"So, I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was, with court reporters, sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, ""There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate."" And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more towards, geared towards legal field rather than just general recording, so I thought, ""Hey, that's perfect."" And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or, something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X many minutes. That's well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes...

Kaspero Law_Bart Kaspero_1_1,"The exact use case was a type of, I don't know how involved you are in the legal landscape, but with my bread and butter, something came out of completely left field. Somebody got what's called a civil citation from a code enforcement officer. The guy who got the civil citation, he was a big landlord. This is not my forte. And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting. So what ended up was through discovery, I got this thumb drive of an hour long meeting, four people I've never met and one with my client. And I'm like, I don't want to watch this thing. It's going to take forever. So I uploaded that thing to Rev, which came as a referral, by the way, from another attorney who is local to me. So I think it was literally, I reached out. Do you use any kind of transcription service? Do you have like a quick and dirty one? Just a quick and dirty, like I don't need some official, I don't need names. I just put the sounds into text and let me just read the damn thing and that turned out to be a 20 something or 30 something page transcription. And I do mean dirty. And that's what I wanted. I didn't want Speaker 1 to be identified. Speaker 2. I just wanted to what the hell are they talking about? And it did the trick. So that was my very first use case. I was not going to use that transcript in any hearing. I simply wanted to read it to see what happened during that one hour hearing. And then I gave it to my client saying, read this. And it was an eye opener to him because if I would have said, go watch that zoom, it would have taken him two weeks to do it. But instead I uploaded those pages and he's like, oh, wow. Yeah, now I know why they ruled against me. He was able to see it with his own eyes. So that was an incredibly useful use case. And that was on the free limited plan, right?

I'll give you one example. I have a client who's had his home was the subject of a search warrant. A criminal search warrant. They executed the search warrant. They took a ton of stuff, and after they execute a search warrant, they give you a property receipt. This is everything we took from your house and it's been a year. They haven't filed charges. He wants his stuff back. I need to file a motion for return of property. I've never done that before. I looked in practice guides. I could not figure it out. I tried to file it in a civil with a civil clerk's office. They rejected it, and they said we cannot initiate a case based on emotion. Unless there's an asset forfeiture proceeding by the government, we cannot initiate a case. There was no asset forfeiture. There's no nothing. There's no case. So I was at my wit's end with this thing, and I talked to colleagues. I posted on CAALA about it. Nobody knew I could not figure it out. I went to ChatGPT and I described the very specific with more specifics that I'm telling you, and it said, you need to go to the criminal clerk, and the criminal clerk can initiate do case initiation under a miscellaneous setting.

I've looked into those services, but it's like another monthly fee like another vendor. It's like that's that's one thing I will say. I, you know, I don't know what like revenue models Rev is considering or has or whatever, but I try to limit my subscriptions because I find even if you can cancel anytime. You know, it's like six months goes by and like, how much was I paying a month? And I think I never like. So I try to stay away from anything with a subscription unless I unless like Acrobat like which I could not do without. So no, I've kind of avoided those. Like all in one we do the billing.

Evenstadlaw_Ben Evenstad_2_2,"So, you know, accuracy is, you know, that's what you want. So I don't know if you're familiar with this, but when a video is shown, let's say, in front of a jury at trial, let's say, you provide the jury with a transcript of what's in the video, and the judge instructs the jury that the transcription is not evidence. Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid. Like kind of follow along and in my experience, it's been like kind of 1 or 2 page like short transcripts, but I've heard of trials where they're going to watch a 45 minute video and they read the transcript. And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show. I don't know if a mid-size or larger firm wouldn't care as much about this, but, you know, I don't have, you know, besides my paralegal, I don't have a support staff. So my time is kind of the most valuable thing. If the transcription can be accurate and not require me to, like, go back over it and fill in a ton of stuff. Then it's just saving me time.

Evenstadlaw_Ben Evenstad_4_1,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because a lot of times, you know, if there's I had a domestic violence case recently where there was six officers on scene and in discovery, we got the body worn of all of them, and all in total, it wound up being three hours or something. And a lot of it was duplicative because there's two officers interviewing one person. So you get both videos. So it's like kind of like waste of time. Again, going back to my time being somewhat valuable, I don't want to sit there for three hours and go over all that. So the summaries, if the summaries have time stamps and it says at 12 minutes and 50s, the officer number one is talking to this person. Then I can go in and watch, like kind of focus in on that part myself. So kind of having like a little roadmap super helpful, but I'm like, I read like a lot of stuff about AI and kind of where we're going with all that. And I'm not an expert by any means, but I can imagine that in a couple of years or whenever that it will be insanely accurate and it will be able to tell you, like, not only, you know, what was said and what the conversation is about, but I don't know, who knows, maybe it'll start coming up with like, you know, subject number two has these legal defenses, like, available to him or whatever. I mean, you know, it's going to put lawyers out of business one day, which whatever. But yeah. So from the like for the summaries. I find that it can be very valuable to, like, point me in the right direction. And so I'm not sitting there just, like, trying to fast forward through through stuff. Because when you do that, you, you also miss stuff. And, you know, I have a duty to my clients, I review everything. There's not one second that I do not review.

I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. So it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the AI.

So again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon.

It gives you the pricing, the services right here. So, 65 minutes. Human. Transcript. Dollar 93 per minute with the 3% subscription discount. The thing is, like, one thing I guess is a bit of a gripe is that the. I feel like the different levels of membership, I feel like should be a reflection of the amount of time that you need, like the anticipated number of minutes or hours of transcription that you'll need and that. That should make the difference in the price. But whether you have the lower number of minutes or the higher number of minutes, I feel like the discount on human transcripts and human captions that the discounts for subscriptions should be the same. It's like it just seems. It just seems silly to me that someone who just needs more time will get a greater discount. We're paying for something. We're paying for less time. I feel like we should get the same discount. So that when we do elect to go for the human involved services that it's, you know, it feels more equitable than like here. We know you don't need a thousand or whatever, 6000 minutes, but pay for it. And that's the only way you get a subscription. Discount is greater than the 3% for the for less because like we've had this for I think a couple of months now and I haven't gone anywhere near the max at all. So there's no reason to get a better subscription level than to get the discount. But then even with the discount, it doesn't offset the additional cost enough.
Drew Giovannoli: Sure, that makes sense. Yes. It's like for the basic plan, the dollar 70 for human versus $1.40 or dollar 39. That's what, $0.31 a minute. So you'd have to use what, 31 100 hours to get 30 bucks saved for it to make sense. So probably 60 to 100 hours or 60 to 100 minutes.
