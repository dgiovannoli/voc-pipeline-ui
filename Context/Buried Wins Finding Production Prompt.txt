Prompt: Buried Wins Finding ProductionObjective:Analyze the provided response data table and produce findings strictly according to the Buried Wins Finding Production Standard. Each finding must meet scoring thresholds and articulation requirements outlined in the standard.Input:You will receive a response data table containing individual response records from B2B SaaS win/loss interviews. Each record represents a discrete piece of feedback from a single respondent.Instructions:Step 1: Apply Finding Production StandardReference the complete Buried Wins Finding Production Standard document provided. This standard governs:? Weighted scoring criteria (Novelty, Tension/Contrast, Materiality, Actionability, Specificity, Metric/Quantification)? Scoring thresholds (5+ points = Finding, 7+ = Priority, 9+ = Critical)? Required articulation structure (IMPACT ? EVIDENCE ? CONTEXT)? Operational definitions and edge case rules? Linguistic standards and quality requirementsStep 2: Analyze Each Response RecordFor each response record in the data table:1. Evaluate content against the 6 weighted scoring criteria2. Apply operational definitions for materiality and business impact3. Follow edge case decision rules for borderline scenarios4. Calculate total score using point values (3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1)5. Determine if threshold met (5+ points required)Step 3: Articulate Qualified FindingsFor each response record scoring 5+ points:1. Create finding title (6-8 words, specific business impact)2. Write Impact statement (²25 words, business consequence leads)3. Write Evidence statement (²35 words, operational details from response)4. Write Context statement (²35 words, market/buyer behavior pattern)5. Apply criterion-specific language requirements6. Complete self-validation checklist before finalizingStep 4: Output FormatPresent each finding using this exact template:**Finding Title:** [6-8 word business impact statement]**Score:** [X points: Criteria breakdown - e.g., "7 points: Materiality (2), Actionability (2), Specificity (2), Metric/Quantification (1)"]**Impact:** [Business consequence/risk/opportunity affecting scope due to specific condition]**Evidence:** [Specific operational detail with quantifiable context under defined business conditions]**Context:** [What pattern reveals about buyer/market behavior]. [Competitive/business implication if applicable].**Source:** [Response record ID, deal context if available]Step 5: Summary OutputAfter individual findings, provide:? Total response records analyzed: [number]? Findings identified: [number] (breakdown by Critical/Priority/Standard)? Response records below threshold: [number]Critical Requirements:? No solutioning - describe what happened, not what should be done? Response data only - no external assumptions or interpretations? Exact word limits - Impact ²25 words, Evidence/Context ²35 words each? Operational definitions - apply materiality and business impact criteria precisely? Self-validation - complete checklist for each finding before submission? Traceability - every claim must trace back to specific response contentQuality Standards:Follow all linguistic standards, anti-patterns, and quality assurance requirements specified in the Finding Production Standard. Prioritize executive brevity with technical precision, avoiding research jargon and maintaining business focus throughout.Now analyze the provided response data table and produce findings according to these specifications.
