Somebody got what's called a civil citation from a code enforcement officer. The guy who got the civil citation, he was a big landlord. This is not my forte. And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting. So what ended up was through discovery, I got this thumb drive of an hour long meeting, four people I've never met and one with my client. And I'm like, I don't want to watch this thing. It's going to take forever. So I uploaded that thing to Rev, which came as a referral, by the way, from another attorney who is local to me. So I think it was literally, I reached out. Do you use any kind of transcription service? Do you have like a quick and dirty one? Just a quick and dirty, like I don't need some official, I don't need names. I just put the sounds into text and let me just read the damn thing and that turned out to be a 20 something or 30 something page transcription. And I do mean dirty. And that's what I wanted. I didn't want Speaker 1 to be identified. Speaker 2. I just wanted to what the hell are they talking about? And it did the trick. So that was my very first use case. I was not going to use that transcript in any hearing. I simply wanted to read it to see what happened during that one hour hearing. And then I gave it to my client saying, read this. And it was an eye opener to him because if I would have said, go watch that zoom, it would have taken him two weeks to do it. But instead I uploaded those pages and he's like, oh, wow. Yeah, now I know why they ruled against me. He was able to see it with his own eyes. So that was an incredibly useful use case. And that was on the free limited plan, right? Where I only have a certain number of megabytes or gigabytes I could upload or number of times, but it was just me dipping my toe in, so it really was good to do that.","So far I've only used the AI, so what I primarily am doing is anytime I get the prosecution gives me body cam police videos, any surveillance video with audio, 911 calls, so anything audio or video, I just upload it and then play around with the transcript function. So instead of speaker one, I change it to the names and then I start to ask it questions. I'm still using my co-counsel AI for the majority of my AI stuff, but I'm using Rev to produce the transcripts and then ask questions specific to the transcripts.","F31,F56,F8,F43,F13","Evenstadlaw,Vandenberglawfirm,Kaspero Law,Vaeziravanilaw,Bjandersonlaw",,,,,,,,,2025-07-18 20:24:47.99843,2025-07-18 20:24:47.99843,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,0,0,Strong,0.00,,
