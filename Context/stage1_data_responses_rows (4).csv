with Ben Evenstad_Interview_1_1,"I had a criminal case where there was a lot of body worn video. And I needed a transcription. And there was, like, I forget how long it was, but it was like, at least 30 minutes and different people talking. So I asked my wife, who works at a mid-size, she's also an attorney, works at a mid-sized defense firm. And they defend public entities, school districts, some local governments, and also big box stores. And their practice is very litigation intensive. So I asked my wife, I said, you know, I can sit here for three hours transcribing a 30 minute video. I'm like, what do you guys do? Do you have a person? Do you have a service? And this is I'd have to go back and look. But this is at least 3 or 4 years ago, maybe even longer. And she's like, oh, we use this company called Rev. It's just like online. So my understanding of the company at that time was that it was like a person doing it somewhere in the world. And so I uploaded the video and paid whatever it was and got it back in, like, like, no, like couple hours, I think. Or maybe the next day. And it was not perfect, but it was very good. And most importantly, to save me time, it identified Officer one. Officer two and it caught the name of the this person that was speaking and that person that was speaking. So it said, like this person said this. And then officer two said that and blah, blah, blah. And so I was like, wow, that's like crazy. And it worked out really well in that case. And to be honest, I didn't have occasion to use it for a long while. And then I more recently used it also for police body worn video. And I think it was AI this time that was doing it or automated that was doing it.

And the court will give you, if you need another four weeks to get the most together, whatever it is. So time is speed is cool, but it's not really. If something took a week, that wouldn't really matter to me generally. So I would say accuracy. Number one. Cost number two. Ease of use I would probably say is my third top one. Maybe then I would say speed. And as far as data security and compliance, you know, I don't have institutional clients. So my clients, the person accused of, you know, getting in the stabbing or the robbery or whatever it is. So, you know, we very much are, you know, confidential and all that, but. Although now that I'm thinking about it, when they give us the body worn video or dash cam video from the police, we do enter into a stipulation. What do they call it? They have like a it's the penal code as a name for it. But you know that that information cannot be by law, cannot be disclosed. So I yeah, I guess data security is important because if for some crazy reason, like a piece of video I uploaded were to like come out on the internet or something, that that would be very bad.

It was like such a huge help. And I've talked to older attorneys where they would have to have their like, you know, support staff do it, or I think there used to be like court reporter services that could also do transcriptions from different videos. And I don't know what they paid back then, but I know what court reporters still cost today, and it's insane.

Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid. Like kind of follow along and in my experience, it's been like kind of 1 or 2 page like short transcripts, but I've heard of trials where they're going to watch a 45 minute video and they read the transcript. And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show. I don't know if a mid-size or larger firm wouldn't care as much about this, but, you know, I don't have, you know, besides my paralegal, I don't have a support staff.

with Ben Evenstad_Interview_4_1,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because a lot of times, you know, if there's I had a domestic violence case recently where there was six officers on scene and in discovery, we got the body worn of all of them, and all in total, it wound up being three hours or something. And a lot of it was duplicative because there's two officers interviewing one person. So you get both videos. So it's like kind of like waste of time. Again, going back to my time being somewhat valuable, I don't want to sit there for three hours and go over all that. So the summaries, if the summaries have time stamps and it says at 12 minutes and 50s, the officer number one is talking to this person. Then I can go in and watch, like kind of focus in on that part myself.

So if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O.

Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search?

I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. It's actually more about the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for a DUI are lower. So if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, so to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not like we're looking at 16 years in prison.

So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, 'There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate.'

And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting.
