I remember, he said it was blue somewhere, like, I know this guy said it was blue, like, where is it? And then you're like, trying to find it, but like, no judge is going to be like, yeah, let me give you a break while you search for 45 minutes to find the part that you want to impeach him with, like they're not going to do it.

But I wanted something that's real, that's running in real time that I can just look over and like I said, I can scroll 10 lines ahead to see what was the word I missed? Something that's more accurate in picking up what's being said so that I don't have to spend hours correcting every single word from not just people's names, but everyday sentences. And I like that it had separate app that I don't have to, because if I have my Zoom on full screen, it's hard for me to tab over. So I like that I can just have it on an app separately, and I prefer running it on my iPad rather than having it on my laptop in the background. And then notification comes in and it might affect things like you did with the prior one.

Now, those don't happen often, but I need to be able to capture the whole thing. So a generous budget of minutes, or not a timer lockout, like some free packages due is also something that was important to me. And I don't mind paying for it. Of course, within reason, if it's 30 bucks a month, that's something different, and it's 300 bucks a month. So yeah, 30 bucks a month is fine.

Now, I did not have to impeach people, in court with anything because they owned up to most things. But the only thing I can think of is that, like, if you want to put it in as an exhibit, I'm not sure, and I have not played around with it enough, but I'm not sure how you would download.

I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things.

I'll give you one example. I have a client who's had his home was the subject of a search warrant. A criminal search warrant. They executed the search warrant. They took a ton of stuff, and after they execute a search warrant, they give you a property receipt. This is everything we took from your house and it's been a year. They haven't filed charges. He wants his stuff back. I need to file a motion for return of property. I've never done that before. I looked in practice guides. I could not figure it out. I tried to file it in a civil with a civil clerk's office. They rejected it, and they said we cannot initiate a case based on emotion. Unless there's an asset forfeiture proceeding by the government, we cannot initiate a case. There was no asset forfeiture. There's no nothing. There's no case. So I was at my wit's end with this thing, and I talked to colleagues. I posted on CAALA about it. Nobody knew I could not figure it out. I went to ChatGPT and I described the very specific with more specifics that I'm telling you, and it said, you need to go to the criminal clerk, and the criminal clerk can initiate do case initiation under a miscellaneous setting. And I called the criminal clerk's office in that county and said, hey, this is what I'm trying to do. And the guy said, yeah, that's exactly how to do it. And I asked ChatGPT, where, where did you get that from? Like where the local rule of court or where is that? And it couldn't tell me where it got it from, but it had the 100% correct thing to do.

I looked at the data security and for what we specifically used it for, it wasn't a big deal because like I said, it was a public hearing. But that could come into play when, like I said, we do witness interviews and things like that. Especially if you have like victims in cases, you can't have a lot of their stuff get out there. So that would be, I think that would be on a case to case basis. Data security.","I would go three then two. Speed, I told you earlier, like I was first time I used I was like, surprised how fast it came back. For the most part, you know, it's whether it's criminal litigation or civil litigation. And I'll just speak for Los Angeles, where I practice. You have a lot of time. And the court will give you, if you need another four weeks to get the most together, whatever it is. So time is speed is cool, but it's not really. If something took a week, that wouldn't really matter to me generally. So I would say accuracy. Number one. Cost number two. Ease of use I would probably say is my third top one. Maybe then I would say speed. And as far as data security and compliance, you know, I don't have institutional clients. So my clients, the person accused of, you know, getting in the stabbing or the robbery or whatever it is. So, you know, we very much are, you know, confidential and all that, but. Although now that I'm thinking about it, when they give us the body worn video or dash cam video from the police, we do enter into a stipulation. What do they call it? They have like a it's the penal code as a name for it. But you know that that information cannot be by law, cannot be disclosed. So I yeah, I guess data security is important because if for some crazy reason, like a piece of video I uploaded were to like come out on the internet or something, that that would be very bad. So that's important. But again, I don't like I don't represent governments. So it's not and then specific features.

And I remember that being something to me that I was like, well, I don't want I don't know how often I'll use it because, you know, as a DA, I would have paid $150 a month, hands down, because I was getting ready for trials all the time. And you also need it just to just get a plea, you know what I mean? Like, sometimes you don't need the transcripts to. I mean, you just need the transcripts to know if you've got a strong enough case to even be worth trying. But on this side, it's not the same. Do you know what I mean? Like like I don't I don't need it that often. And so I was like, I don't know as a new firm that I can justify. And I know $150 a month. That's not that huge of expense. But I was like, I'm trying to keep my overhead low, and I'm already paying for subscriptions for like a gazillion other things that I pay for.

No. Give me like an like what would. In some cases the transcript could be integrated into a workflow, like into another software for additional processing or part of a broader workflow in general.

No, I don't, I am pretty old school and I, you know, I have my Adobe Acrobat, which is like the most powerful piece of software I have. And. No, so I kind of I keep it basic.

So I try to stay away from anything with a subscription unless I unless like Acrobat like which I could not do without. So no, I've kind of avoided those. Like all in one we do the billing.

Ben Evenstad: Well, like that example I gave when it identified the different speakers where it's not, you know, clear who's speaking. It's not let's say a you know, I'm just imagining this, but if there was like a, you know, let's say you wanted, you had a recording of a phone call where it was, you know, Jen and David and then it'd be pretty easy to say Jen said this, David said that, blah blah, blah. But again, the situations I'm talking about where it's like multiple parties, some things are kind of muffled or some person over here says something, but the video is not on them, so you don't know, but you could put it together like a minute later. So the more that it it could identify each person that is talking and if it could and I know you can, you know, control f and change person one to officer whoever like throughout the whole thing. But if it could identify each speaker that would be huge. And do it again accurately.","I needed a real life transcript that runs along as people are speaking. There are tools that record, and then you upload it and then they give you a transcript. But I wanted something that's real, that's running in real time that I can just look over and like I said, I can scroll 10 lines ahead to see what was the word I missed? Something that's more accurate in picking up what's being said so that I don't have to spend hours correcting every single word from not just people's names, but everyday sentences. And I like that it had separate app that I don't have to, because if I have my Zoom on full screen, it's hard for me to tab over. So I like that I can just have it on an app separately, and I prefer running it on my iPad rather than having it on my laptop in the background. And then notification comes in and it might affect things like you did with the prior one. So yeah, those were, and also I wanted as little limitations as possible because I've had depos that went for 30 minutes and I've had depos that went for five hours and up. Now, those don't happen often, but I need to be able to capture the whole thing. So a generous budget of minutes, or not a timer lockout, like some free packages due is also something that was important to me. And I don't mind paying for it. Of course, within reason, if it's 30 bucks a month, that's something different, and it's 300 bucks a month. So yeah, 30 bucks a month is fine.

So it said, like this person said this. And then officer two said that and blah, blah, blah. And so I was like, wow, that's like crazy. And it worked out really well in that case.
