Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_1,"So, I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was, with court reporters, sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, ""There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate."" And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more towards, geared towards legal field rather than just general recording, so I thought, ""Hey, that's perfect."" And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or, something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X many minutes. That's well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes... Unlike the previous one, which I'll remember, I was able to download the app and use it on my iPad. So, I would have my laptop, just like I have it with you. I would have my iPad right next to me, and I would be running the Rev app. And I can just look over on my screen and see it going on line by line. So, I really like that.",Product Features,How have you used Rev so far?,closed_won,Vandenberg Law Firm,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_2,"But I would say my biggest issue, and something that's been happening every single time, whenever we go on break, and I hit pause, and then we come back from a break, and I resume, it starts writing me an essay. It doesn't separate it anymore.",Product Features,"Is there anything else that's like a frustration for you, an obstacle about it?",closed_won,Vandenberg Law Firm,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_2_1,"I have recently noticed that when I'm... 'Cause it says that I can record even when I'm offline, but it doesn't give me a transcript. It only gives me the sound wave. So the other day, I was working remotely out of a client's office, and his Wi-Fi was down, so we were using the hotspot off my phone, which wasn't really great for that position. So, to save on bandwidth, we just shut everything off, and we just both used my laptop, and we had a Zoom video depo. So, I didn't connect my iPad to save some bandwidth, and the only thing I could get is the sound wave. Now, I know it recorded it, and then later, it transcribed it, but it would have been helpful, since it's just using the voice coming out of my speakers, if it could still write it out as we go.",Product Features,"Is there anything else that's like a frustration for you, an obstacle about it?",closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_2_2,"I was wondering if there is a way, like, let's say I'm using my iPad, to somehow connect it so that it doesn't record the noise coming out of my speakers so it can record directly. 'Cause sometimes it will be better if I can put my headphones on and still have it recorded. But if I do that, it'll just pick up my voice and not the sound of the depo, or the sound of the Zoom call. So, I'm wondering if there is a way, if... Maybe I'm just... Maybe I didn't read the instructions, or if there's something that can be built later on. If there's a way to connect it so that it records and takes the audio directly from within the Zoom meeting instead of me playing it out loud through speakers, and it picking up the sound coming out of my speakers.",Product Features,"What tools do you use, like case management software or anything else?",closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_3_1,"I have not. I mean, I've used the summarization for the transcript to give me... To find specific keywords or find specific sections within the recording. Other than that, I haven't really explored other AI functions outside of that, which is on my to-do list when I get to it.",AI Capabilities,"Have you used Filevine's AI capabilities, any of Rev's AI capabilities?",closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_3_2,"Also, I was wondering on the subject of improvement, since I thought Rev was supposed to be a little more legal-oriented, I noticed that it has sometimes hard time picking up specific legal jargon. And I thought maybe there could be some sort of dictionary included within so that it's picking up words that sound like it are more like this. For example, let me see. There was a... Oh, yeah. Somebody raised an objection. Asked and answered. And I see the transcription says asset and asset. And I'm thinking, well, like basic objections, vague, argumentative, asked and answered should be built in so that the system knows when something like that sounds like the objection, it's probably this.",Improvements,"On the subject of improvement, since you thought Rev was supposed to be a little more legal-oriented, are there any specific suggestions you have?",closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01

Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_4_1,"So I needed a real-time transcript that runs along as people are speaking. There are tools that record and then you upload it and then they give you a transcript. But I wanted something that's real, that's running in real time that I can just look over and, like I said, I can scroll 10 lines ahead to see what was the word I missed. Something that's more accurate in picking up what's being said so that I don't have to spend hours correcting every single word from not just people's names, but everyday sentences. And I like that it had separate app that I don't have to... 'Cause if I have my Zoom on full screen, it's hard for me to like tab over. So it's, I like that I can just have it on an app separately and I prefer running it on my iPad rather than having it on my laptop in the background. And then, you know, notification comes in and it might affect things like it did with the prior one. So yeah, those were... And also, I wanted as little limitations as possible because I've had depos that went for 30 minutes and I've had depos that went for five hours and up. Now those, they don't happen often, but I need to be able to capture the whole thing. So, a generous budget of minutes, or not a timer lockout like some like free packages do is also something that was important to me. And I don't mind paying for it, of course within reason. If it's 30 bucks a month that's something different than it's 300 bucks a month. So yeah, 30 bucks a month is fine. But yeah, something that has a capability of going for as long as I need it to, for hours if need be.",Product Features,What was important to you as you looked for a tool to make it worth your time?,closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_4_2,"Yeah, I would download it. I would download, let's say the Word version and then it highlights it speaker one, speaker two, speaker three. So then I would just change the names to whoever was speaking at that time. Oh, that was also another thing that was a little bit frustrating. While I see the transcript running, it just gives me timestamps, but it doesn't break it up into different speakers. So while it's running, it says, one hour, 52, 53 seconds, one hour, 52, 54 seconds. And it goes like line by line, but it doesn't like separate it into speakers until the transcript's fully uploaded, generated and downloaded. So, which was something that the previous site was doing, except their audio picking up system was horrible. But it was nice where I could see speaker one or if I put in the name, you know, Drew and then paragraph from you and then Alex, and then sentences from me and then back to Drew.",Implementation Process,What do you do with the transcript after it's fully received?,closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_5_1,"I would share it within my team, with my coworkers. Or let's say I'm associating in on a case, then I would share it with the attorney that's primary that's handling on the case. So, I would share it internally. But my primary purpose is just for my own reference. For me to be able to keep track while I'm in the depo. And for me to be able to reflect on it immediately after the depo when I'm providing, let's say, the supervising attorney or the handling attorney. When I'm providing them the summary of, 'Hey, I attended your depo. This is what happened.' So that's, so primarily for my own use. But I've shared it with them before too, especially if there is some notable testimony that I want to highlight. 'Can you believe this guy said?' And I want word-for-word.",Product Features,"When you have the transcripts, are you only for internal use, or are you ever sharing it, submitting it, using it externally?",closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_5_2,"Maybe, like I said, having a plug-in directly into Zoom. Because I think 99% of stuff nowadays happens on Zoom, whether it's hearings or depositions. Now, I know a lot of people use their favorite court reporting agency, and then they... But it ends up mostly on Zoom. So, if there was a button on Zoom, just like you have record button. If there was a plug-in you can install, Rev button, that gives you the ability to run a transcript. That would be helpful. And that way, hopefully it'll pick up the sound directly from within the hearing, or within the Zoom meeting. Rather than just me having to manually...",Integration,What integrations could Rev create that would help you with your job?,closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_6_2,"Maybe if it's, like for example, specifically for me, when I'm dealing with personal injury. Usually the depositions get broken up into several categories. The person's background, the accident itself, the medical treatment, and their life afterwards. Whether it's for most parties and for most types of accidents. Whether it's somebody slipping at Target or somebody being pancaked by an 18-wheeler, it's the same procedure. So, if I could maybe set up categories, or maybe tell the summary to look out for these four issue areas. Or however many there may be for a specific attorney's preference. If I could teach it, you know, when you're doing me... When you're writing me the summary. ""Tell me about the person's prior accidents or prior injuries, history, whatever was said. Tell me about medical treatment. Like, look for keywords of doctor this, doctor that. And summarize medical treatment."" Like, I don't know if that's too specific? Or if I can put in keywords. Search for the keywords accident, then highlight everything that the guy said with the word ""accident"". Although, accident might be too general. But let's say I go through the guy's medical records and there is Dr. Smith. And then I would just put in a prompt saying, ""Highlight everything about Dr. Smith that's being said."" Or point it out in the summary. Let's say Dr. Smith performed a surgery that I'm arguing was not necessary. And plaintiff's attorney says it's absolutely necessary. And we might be going back and forth several times over what Dr. Smith did or didn't do. So, kind of, instead of me downloading the transcript and then control F and trying to figure it out. If in the summary it could focus on whatever the hook is that I would ask for it to search for.",Implementation Process,What challenges did you face during setup?,closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
