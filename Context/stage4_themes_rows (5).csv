Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid.

And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show. I don't know if a mid-size or larger firm wouldn't care as much about this, but, you know, I don't have, you know, besides my paralegal, I don't have a support staff. So my time is kind of the most valuable thing. If the transcription can be accurate and not require me to, like, go back over it and fill in a ton of stuff. Then it's just saving me time.

This finding indicates a need for improved audio management features to reinforce user experience.,COMPETITIVE VULNERABILITY,"Won: 1, Lost: 0",,"So I'm wondering if that's possible or if that has to be connected to a hire smarter machine to be able to do that. So that was just a point of curiosity. That's great. And yeah, other than that, oh, I did have a question. I was wondering, since it works off of the iPad speaker or my computer speaker, unless I specifically hit pause, there were several times where I didn't hit pause during my break just so it doesn't interrupt and write me an essay. And then I noticed when I came back, it picked up my side conversation with my colleague, so I was wondering, and then so I would've to go back and edit it. So I was wondering if there is a way, let's say I'm using my iPad to somehow connect it so that it doesn't record the noise coming out of my speakers so I can record directly. Sometimes it'll be better if I can put my headphones on and still have it recorded, but if I do that, it'll just pick up my voice and not the sound of the depo or sound of the Zoom call. So I'm wondering if there is a way, if maybe I didn't read the instructions or if there's something that can be built later on, if there is a way to connect it so that it records and takes the audio directly from within the Zoom meeting instead of me playing it out loud through speakers and it picking up the sound coming out of my speakers.",,"F68,F63,F7",,,,,,,,,,2025-07-15 19:36:17.026494,2025-07-15 19:36:17.026494

This finding indicates a key challenge that can reinforce client engagement and satisfaction.,COMPETITIVE VULNERABILITY,"Won: 1, Lost: 0",,"I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through.

So let me give you an example. Because I, you know, I feel like people, attorneys or lay people or whatever, that, like, they don't understand what is happening with and like how fast things are about to change and are changing have already changed. I'll give you one example. I have a client who's had his home was the subject of a search warrant. A criminal search warrant. They executed the search warrant. They took a ton of stuff, and after they execute a search warrant, they give you a property receipt. This is everything we took from your house and it's been a year. They haven't filed charges. He wants his stuff back. I need to file a motion for return of property. I've never done that before. I looked in practice guides. I could not figure it out. I tried to file it in a civil with a civil clerk's office. They rejected it, and they said we cannot initiate a case based on emotion. Unless there's an asset forfeiture proceeding by the government, we cannot initiate a case. There was no asset forfeiture. There's no nothing. There's no case. So I was at my wit's end with this thing, and I talked to colleagues. I posted on CAALA about it. Nobody knew I could not figure it out. I went to ChatGPT and I described the very specific with more specifics that I'm telling you, and it said, you need to go to the criminal clerk, and the criminal clerk can initiate do case initiation under a miscellaneous setting. And I called the criminal clerk's office in that county and said, hey, this is what I'm trying to do. And the guy said, yeah, that's exactly how to do it. And I asked ChatGPT, where, where did you get that from? Like where the local rule of court or where is that? And it couldn't tell me where it got it from, but it had the 100% correct thing to do.

But the thing is, like, I would sacrifice speed for better accuracy. Gladly. If it took twice as long. Three times as like, I think it's done like a 45 minute file audio file in like seven minutes. Even if it took an hour, I'd be happy to to to sacrifice speed for accuracy. Yeah. Costs, I think is fine, right? It's fine. Because if it were with the given, with the current accuracy, I'd have a hard time justifying a greater cost because of how much work I've had to do. Editing the transcript to have it be a faithful transcript. So I think sacrificing speed in the interest of accuracy at the current cost would make sense. But if in future there's a way to. So yeah, speed exceeded my expectations. Cost my expectations. Accuracy fell below my expectations. Data security and compliance met expectations. Ease of use. Once I figured out how, you know, double clicking that you can essentially treat it like a word doc.

I actually was in school to do transcription and I timed out, so I wasn't able to do it and I had 0.5% left. So that was unfortunate. But it is definitely nice to have an option like Rev to take care of that transcript, especially when you're busy and you don't have time. I mean, a lot of times it takes two to three weeks maybe, and that's the soonest with any other transcription.","Definitely the turnaround time and the availability and the accuracy. Those are probably the three most important because you are just, you're trying to put in, it's easier, like I said, to see the words instead of replaying it over and over again.
