Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_1,"So, I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was, with court reporters, sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, 'There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate.' And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more towards, geared towards legal field rather than just general recording, so I thought, 'Hey, that's perfect.' And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or, something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X many minutes. That's well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes...

Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid. Like kind of follow along and in my experience, it's been like kind of 1 or 2 page like short transcripts, but I've heard of trials where they're going to watch a 45 minute video and they read the transcript. And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show.

Unknown_Brian Anderson_1_1,"So I've had a subscription with Westlaw for a decade and I got co-counsel AI a couple of years ago. And one of the things that I really needed done was transcribing videos, so like body cam, police communications, radio communications, interviews, and I needed it done quick. So if I send it to a transcriber, some transcribers, they don't want to do body cam work at all because it's hard to understand. And then if I'm sending out a recorded interview where the quality of the audio is better, it still could take a month. And I am a trial court attorney. So what that means is I am in front of the judge a lot and sometimes my clients are arrested and I don't have time to wait a month for stuff to come in. So I just was talking with my AI and it said, I may even ask the question, can I upload a video and have it transcribed? I knew I couldn't do it when I first got it, but then the answer recommended like Rev and then some other one. And so I looked at them both. I don't remember what the other one was, but I tried Rev and I did the trial or the free account, whatever it was, and I was like, oh, this is awesome. I can just upload a video and it gives me a transcript right away. I just loved the interaction and how it works. So it took me two days to be like, I need to just sign up for a pay subscription.",Product Features,How did you come across Rev?

Unknown_Brian Anderson_2_2,"Yeah, so the AI I have through Westlaw co-counsel, there's two main parts that I use it for. One is the legal research. So instead of doing, do you know what Westlaw is? It's a Thomson Reuters AI software. I know that, but I haven't used it. Yeah, so Westlaw is, it's almost like Google for lawyers, but instead of the internet, it's like case law. So 50 years ago you'd have to go to a law library and look up cases and laws and books and Westlaw has everything digitized. So you can search statutes, case law decisions, like all that stuff in their Westlaw database. And so what it used to be just a regular search word, you search a term you put and or you put parentheses and use that awkward language to try and find what you're looking for. But now with the AI, you can just ask it a question like, Hey, here's my scenario. My client's charged with assault and battery dangerous weapon and he's wearing Crocs. Are crocs a dangerous weapon or can you find cases that talk about what a dangerous weapon is? And the AI works through the Westlaw database, so it will scan all the cases and then highlight stuff for me. So it really makes my research much, much more effective and really speeds things up for me. And then the second part of the AI that they have is you can use it to brainstorm cases. So for example, I'll say like, Hey, this is a self-defense case and I'm going to upload all of the evidence I have and then I can ask you questions and I could say, okay, here's a police report. Here's grand jury minutes, here's a victim statement, here's all the evidence I have from the prosecution. Where did the victim say X? Where did the victim say Y? And so it can create charts and highlight things for me. I can also brainstorm with it. So I'll be like, Hey, this is self-defense, come up with 10 catchy phrases that I could use. So I have discussions like that, but the thing it wasn't doing was producing transcripts of body cam, so I would have to have a transcript done and then upload it. And that's where Rev comes in that I use Rev to produce the transcripts to then upload into co-counsel.",Implementation Process,What challenges did you face during setup?,closed_won,Unknown,Brian Anderson,2024-01-01,stage1_processing,2025-07-18 14:43:48.039984,2025-07-18 14:43:48.231494,Rev,pending,,,{},,,,,,
Unknown_Brian Anderson_4_2,"Yeah, something like that would be really helpful because a lot of times with a case I have to read carefully to highlight those discrepancies. So if there is AI that is doing that for me, that would speed things up tremendously. Sometimes the body cam is like four hours long because they turn it on at the start of the interaction and then they turn it off at the conclusion. And if it's a really intense case that's going on for a long time, you have these incredibly long videos. Also, if there's five officers responding and each one turns on the body cam, you're getting five versions of the same thing. So it can be very time consuming to go through that. And a lot more police departments are getting body cam, so the amount of information that I have to go through, it's getting pretty large.",AI Discrepancy Detection and Time Efficiency,"If discrepancies were highlighted every time you uploaded the body cam and police summary, would that be helpful?",closed_won,Unknown,Brian Anderson,2024-01-01,stage1_processing,2025-07-18 14:43:48.800417,2025-07-18 14:43:48.851543,Rev,pending,,,{},,,,,,

Then what I do is I take those same documents and upload them into Rev. So I'm kind of doing the same thing in each platform, uploading it. It'd be cool if I could upload it one place and it appeared in both. I upload it in My Case and it automatically generates a transcript in Rev. That would be a cool feature rather than me having these two separate systems because what I do now in Rev, I create a new folder for basically every case, upload the documents to that case.

Unknown_Brian Anderson_3_2,"Yeah, so that's a really good example. So what I'd say, so in Massachusetts, and I assume every, I'll just speak to Massachusetts where I am, we have jury instructions for pretty much every type of offense you can have. And the jury instructions, it's basically like a checklist for the jury. So it's what the judge reads to the jury. So they say when assault and battery, it's any unlawful touching and these three things have to be present. It would be cool to kind of take all those jury instructions and then say like, Hey Rev, I'm uploading body cam from an assault and battery case. Where are these elements in place? So if it's an assault and battery and there's three elements, identify each statement that is element one or element two or element three, that'd be something that'd be kind of cool.

Unknown_Brian Anderson_4_4,"Yeah, and I have this major caveat that I may be missing the obvious way to fix it. So let's say I upload a body cam and like I said, a lot of transcribers, they don't like body cam because there's people talking and their voices overlap. And so sometimes what I notice is in the transcript, I'm getting the paragraph, but sometimes two different people are speaking. It's like one person is the first half of the paragraph and then person two will speak and then person one speaks again. But I see in Rev it's all just like one long paragraph and I almost want there to be a way where I can split it up and say like, oh, this is a gap where the other person talked. Let's say there's a paragraph that is four sentences, sentences one, three and four are John Smith sentence number two is Peter Smith, but on the Rev transcript it's showing up as just one person.

So that's the main purpose and our limited binding arbitration hearings. They aren't. We don't have an abundance of them in the sense that it's an equal proportion to our district court cases.

Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_1,"I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. So it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the AI.

I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. It's actually more about the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for a DUI are lower. So if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it.
