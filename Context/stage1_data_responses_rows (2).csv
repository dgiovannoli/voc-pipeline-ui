Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_1,"So, I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was, with court reporters, sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, ""There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate."" And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more towards, geared towards legal field rather than just general recording, so I thought, ""Hey, that's perfect."" And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or, something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X many minutes. That's well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes... Unlike the previous one, which I'll remember, I was able to download the app and use it on my iPad. So, I would have my laptop, just like I have it with you.

Somebody got what's called a civil citation from a code enforcement officer. The guy who got the civil citation, he was a big landlord. This is not my forte. And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting. So what ended up was through discovery, I got this thumb drive of an hour long meeting, four people I've never met and one with my client. And I'm like, I don't want to watch this thing. It's going to take forever. So I uploaded that thing to Rev, which came as a referral, by the way, from another attorney who is local to me. So I think it was literally, I reached out.

I just put the sounds into text and let me just read the damn thing and that turned out to be a 20 something or 30 something page transcription. And I do mean dirty. And that's what I wanted. I didn't want Speaker 1 to be identified. Speaker 2. I just wanted to what the hell are they talking about? And it did the trick. So that was my very first use case. I was not going to use that transcript in any hearing. I simply wanted to read it to see what happened during that one hour hearing. And then I gave it to my client saying, read this. And it was an eye opener to him because if I would have said, go watch that zoom, it would have taken him two weeks to do it. But instead I uploaded those pages and he's like, oh, wow. Yeah, now I know why they ruled against me. He was able to see it with his own eyes. So that was an incredibly useful use case. And that was on the free limited plan, right?

They have like a it's the penal code as a name for it. But you know that that information cannot be by law, cannot be disclosed. So I yeah, I guess data security is important because if for some crazy reason, like a piece of video I uploaded were to like come out on the internet or something, that that would be very bad.

Unknown_Ben Evenstad_4_1,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because a lot of times, you know, if there's I had a domestic violence case recently where there was six officers on scene and in discovery, we got the body worn of all of them, and all in total, it wound up being three hours or something. And a lot of it was duplicative because there's two officers interviewing one person. So you get both videos. So it's like kind of like waste of time. Again, going back to my time being somewhat valuable, I don't want to sit there for three hours and go over all that. So the summaries, if the summaries have time stamps and it says at 12 minutes and 50s, the officer number one is talking to this person.

I'll give you one example. I have a client who's had his home was the subject of a search warrant. A criminal search warrant. They executed the search warrant. They took a ton of stuff, and after they execute a search warrant, they give you a property receipt. This is everything we took from your house and it's been a year. They haven't filed charges. He wants his stuff back. I need to file a motion for return of property. I've never done that before. I looked in practice guides. I could not figure it out.

I went to ChatGPT and I described the very specific with more specifics that I'm telling you, and it said, you need to go to the criminal clerk, and the criminal clerk can initiate do case initiation under a miscellaneous setting.

Unknown_Brian Anderson_2_2,"Yeah, so the AI I have through Westlaw co-counsel, there's two main parts that I use it for. One is the legal research. So instead of doing, do you know what Westlaw is? It's a Thomson Reuters AI software. I know that, but I haven't used it. Yeah, so Westlaw is, it's almost like Google for lawyers, but instead of the internet, it's like case law. So 50 years ago you'd have to go to a law library and look up cases and laws and books and Westlaw has everything digitized. So you can search statutes, case law decisions, like all that stuff in their Westlaw database. And so what it used to be just a regular search word, you search a term you put and or you put parentheses and use that awkward language to try and find what you're looking for. But now with the AI, you can just ask it a question like, Hey, here's my scenario. My client's charged with assault and battery dangerous weapon and he's wearing Crocs. Are crocs a dangerous weapon or can you find cases that talk about what a dangerous weapon is? And the AI works through the Westlaw database, so it will scan all the cases and then highlight stuff for me. So it really makes my research much, much more effective and really speeds things up for me. And then the second part of the AI that they have is you can use it to brainstorm cases. So for example, I'll say like, Hey, this is a self-defense case and I'm going to upload all of the evidence I have and then I can ask you questions and I could say, okay, here's a police report. Here's grand jury minutes, here's a victim statement, here's all the evidence I have from the prosecution. Where did the victim say X? Where did the victim say Y? And so it can create charts and highlight things for me. I can also brainstorm with it. So I'll be like, Hey, this is self-defense, come up with 10 catchy phrases that I could use. So I have discussions like that, but the thing it wasn't doing was producing transcripts of body cam, so I would have to have a transcript done and then upload it.

Unknown_Brian Anderson_4_4,"Yeah, and I have this major caveat that I may be missing the obvious way to fix it. So let's say I upload a body cam and like I said, a lot of transcribers, they don't like body cam because there's people talking and their voices overlap. And so sometimes what I notice is in the transcript, I'm getting the paragraph, but sometimes two different people are speaking. It's like one person is the first half of the paragraph and then person two will speak and then person one speaks again. But I see in Rev it's all just like one long paragraph and I almost want there to be a way where I can split it up and say like, oh, this is a gap where the other person talked. Let's say there's a paragraph that is four sentences, sentences one, three and four are John Smith sentence number two is Peter Smith, but on the Rev transcript it's showing up as just one person.

Unknown_Brian Anderson_4_2,"Yeah, something like that would be really helpful because a lot of times with a case I have to read carefully to highlight those discrepancies. So if there is AI that is doing that for me, that would speed things up tremendously. Sometimes the body cam is like four hours long because they turn it on at the start of the interaction and then they turn it off at the conclusion. And if it's a really intense case that's going on for a long time, you have these incredibly long videos. Also, if there's five officers responding and each one turns on the body cam, you're getting five versions of the same thing. So it can be very time consuming to go through that.

And the jury instructions, it's basically like a checklist for the jury. So it's what the judge reads to the jury. So they say when assault and battery, it's any unlawful touching and these three things have to be present. It would be cool to kind of take all those jury instructions and then say like, Hey Rev, I'm uploading body cam from an assault and battery case. Where are these elements in place? So if it's an assault and battery and there's three elements, identify each statement that is element one or element two or element three, that'd be something that'd be kind of cool.

Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_1,"I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at?

Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. So it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the AI.

Unknown_Yusuf Elmarakby_1_3,"Oftentimes we're sent a lot of body camera footage. Whenever we want to know what's being said by law enforcement or people that are interacting with law enforcement, sometimes it is very hard to hear through the body camera footage. Given that it's a small device, the audio that is captured is pretty faint. We kind of just want to know what's going on in the surveillance footage, or we want to read along with the video that we're watching just to make sure everything corroborates to the situation at hand and what's actually happening. We oftentimes use it when listening to phone calls when we want to know exactly what's happening because phone calls, sometimes people's voices go in and out or they're faint or they have an accent, or they're speaking too low or too loud. We just want to know exactly what's going on, because in the world of criminal justice, it is very scrutinizing and important to know what exactly is being said and what is being addressed.",Product Features,Can you talk about all the different things you might use Rev for in different types of cases?,closed_won,Unknown,Yusuf Elmarakby,2024-01-01,stage1_processing,2025-07-18 14:14:59.350518,2025-07-18 14:14:59.396727,Rev,pending,,,{},,,,,,

Unknown_Yusuf Elmarakby_1_2,"It's just a simple, tiresome act of having to watch surveillance footage and just writing down what they're saying for clarity. It's a lifesaver to use Rev to be able to just have a full transcription and go back and watch the video or listen to the call and match it up with what's being sent to us. It just saves a lot of time and efficiency and working on these people's cases and guaranteeing them the results that we're being retained to give.
