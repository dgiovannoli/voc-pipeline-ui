Bjandersonlaw_Brian Anderson_3_2,"Yeah, so that's a really good example. So what I'd say, so in Massachusetts, and I assume every, I'll just speak to Massachusetts where I am, we have jury instructions for pretty much every type of offense you can have. And the jury instructions, it's basically like a checklist for the jury. So it's what the judge reads to the jury. So they say when assault and battery, it's any unlawful touching and these three things have to be present. It would be cool to kind of take all those jury instructions and then say like, Hey Rev, I'm uploading body cam from an assault and battery case. Where are these elements in place? So if it's an assault and battery and there's three elements, identify each statement that is element one or element two or element three, that'd be something that'd be kind of cool.

It'd be nice to have both of those together to compare. So for example, I would ask my AI a question like, Hey, what's the description in the police report? And then what the witness actually said, and maybe there's a difference and that'd be something that I'd want to know to compare those two.",Integration,"In the searching you're doing in Rev, are there ever documents that you wish you could use some of the AI searching to additional things beyond just the transcripts?",Closed Won,Bjandersonlaw,Brian Anderson,2025-05-23,stage1_processing,2025-07-17 13:13:16.406979,2025-07-17 18:13:16.500456,Rev,pending,,,{},,
Bjandersonlaw_Brian Anderson_2_2,"Yeah, so the AI I have through Westlaw co-counsel, there's two main parts that I use it for. One is the legal research. So instead of doing, do you know what Westlaw is? It's a Thomson Reuters AI software. I know that, but I haven't used it. Yeah, so Westlaw is, it's almost like Google for lawyers, but instead of the internet, it's like case law. So 50 years ago you'd have to go to a law library and look up cases and laws and books and Westlaw has everything digitized. So you can search statutes, case law decisions, like all that stuff in their Westlaw database. And so what it used to be just a regular search word, you search a term you put and or you put parentheses and use that awkward language to try and find what you're looking for. But now with the AI, you can just ask it a question like, Hey, here's my scenario. My client's charged with assault and battery dangerous weapon and he's wearing Crocs. Are crocs a dangerous weapon or can you find cases that talk about what a dangerous weapon is? And the AI works through the Westlaw database, so it will scan all the cases and then highlight stuff for me. So it really makes my research much, much more effective and really speeds things up for me. And then the second part of the AI that they have is you can use it to brainstorm cases. So for example, I'll say like, Hey, this is a self-defense case and I'm going to upload all of the evidence I have and then I can ask you questions and I could say, okay, here's a police report. Here's grand jury minutes, here's a victim statement, here's all the evidence I have from the prosecution. Where did the victim say X? Where did the victim say Y? And so it can create charts and highlight things for me. I can also brainstorm with it. So I'll be like, Hey, this is self-defense, come up with 10 catchy phrases that I could use. So I have discussions like that, but the thing it wasn't doing was producing transcripts of body cam, so I would have to have a transcript done and then upload it.

It'd be cool if I could upload it one place and it appeared in both. I upload it in My Case and it automatically generates a transcript in Rev. That would be a cool feature rather than me having these two separate systems because what I do now in Rev, I create a new folder for basically every case, upload the documents to that case.

Bjandersonlaw_Brian Anderson_4_2,"Yeah, something like that would be really helpful because a lot of times with a case I have to read carefully to highlight those discrepancies. So if there is AI that is doing that for me, that would speed things up tremendously. Sometimes the body cam is like four hours long because they turn it on at the start of the interaction and then they turn it off at the conclusion. And if it's a really intense case that's going on for a long time, you have these incredibly long videos. Also, if there's five officers responding and each one turns on the body cam, you're getting five versions of the same thing. So it can be very time consuming to go through that.

Bjandersonlaw_Brian Anderson_4_4,"Yeah, and I have this major caveat that I may be missing the obvious way to fix it. So let's say I upload a body cam and like I said, a lot of transcribers, they don't like body cam because there's people talking and their voices overlap. And so sometimes what I notice is in the transcript, I'm getting the paragraph, but sometimes two different people are speaking. It's like one person is the first half of the paragraph and then person two will speak and then person one speaks again. But I see in Rev it's all just like one long paragraph and I almost want there to be a way where I can split it up and say like, oh, this is a gap where the other person talked. Let's say there's a paragraph that is four sentences, sentences one, three and four are John Smith sentence number two is Peter Smith, but on the Rev transcript it's showing up as just one person.

But the issue with transcribing is you still need to deposit every, you know, 10s to catch up or whatever. And if you need to put like an ellipses in there or whatever you need to do, it's like just I really it just takes so much time, and I was willing. I mean, don't tell them this, but I was willing to pay anything to, like, not have to sit there and do that. So to get like, a reliable transcript of a piece of video for a fairly nominal cost. It was like such a huge help. And I've talked to older attorneys where they would have to have their like, you know, support staff do it, or I think there used to be like court reporter services that could also do transcriptions from different videos. And I don't know what they paid back then, but I know what court reporters still cost today, and it's insane. So I don't know if this answers the question, but just to have that transcription like ability and quick. And the cost is in the right zone. That's like.

So I don't know if you're familiar with this, but when a video is shown, let's say, in front of a jury at trial, let's say, you provide the jury with a transcript of what's in the video, and the judge instructs the jury that the transcription is not evidence. Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid. Like kind of follow along and in my experience, it's been like kind of 1 or 2 page like short transcripts, but I've heard of trials where they're going to watch a 45 minute video and they read the transcript. And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show. I don't know if a mid-size or larger firm wouldn't care as much about this, but, you know, I don't have, you know, besides my paralegal, I don't have a support staff. So my time is kind of the most valuable thing. If the transcription can be accurate and not require me to, like, go back over it and fill in a ton of stuff. Then it's just saving me time.

They have like a it's the penal code as a name for it. But you know that that information cannot be by law, cannot be disclosed. So I yeah, I guess data security is important because if for some crazy reason, like a piece of video I uploaded were to like come out on the internet or something, that that would be very bad.

Vandenberglawfirm_Alex Vandenberg_1_1,"So, I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was, with court reporters, sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, 'There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate.' And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more towards, geared towards legal field rather than just general recording, so I thought, 'Hey, that's perfect.' And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or, something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X many minutes. That's well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes... Unlike the previous one, which I'll remember, I was able to download the app and use it on my iPad. So, I would have my laptop, just like I have it with you.

And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting. So what ended up was through discovery, I got this thumb drive of an hour long meeting, four people I've never met and one with my client. And I'm like, I don't want to watch this thing. It's going to take forever. So I uploaded that thing to Rev, which came as a referral, by the way, from another attorney who is local to me. So I think it was literally, I reached out.

I just put the sounds into text and let me just read the damn thing and that turned out to be a 20 something or 30 something page transcription. And I do mean dirty. And that's what I wanted. I didn't want Speaker 1 to be identified. Speaker 2. I just wanted to what the hell are they talking about? And it did the trick. So that was my very first use case. I was not going to use that transcript in any hearing. I simply wanted to read it to see what happened during that one hour hearing. And then I gave it to my client saying, read this. And it was an eye opener to him because if I would have said, go watch that zoom, it would have taken him two weeks to do it. But instead I uploaded those pages and he's like, oh, wow. Yeah, now I know why they ruled against me. He was able to see it with his own eyes. So that was an incredibly useful use case. And that was on the free limited plan, right?

Unknown_Brian Anderson_1_1,"So I've had a subscription with Westlaw for a decade and I got co-counsel AI a couple of years ago. And one of the things that I really needed done was transcribing videos, so like body cam, police communications, radio communications, interviews, and I needed it done quick. So if I send it to a transcriber, some transcribers, they don't want to do body cam work at all because it's hard to understand. And then if I'm sending out a recorded interview where the quality of the audio is better, it still could take a month. And I am a trial court attorney. So what that means is I am in front of the judge a lot and sometimes my clients are arrested and I don't have time to wait a month for stuff to come in. So I just was talking with my AI and it said, I may even ask the question, can I upload a video and have it transcribed? I knew I couldn't do it when I first got it, but then the answer recommended like Rev and then some other one. And so I looked at them both. I don't remember what the other one was, but I tried Rev and I did the trial or the free account, whatever it was, and I was like, oh, this is awesome. I can just upload a video and it gives me a transcript right away. I just loved the interaction and how it works.

And if it's a really intense case that's going on for a long time, you have these incredibly long videos. Also, if there's five officers responding and each one turns on the body cam, you're getting five versions of the same thing. So it can be very time consuming to go through that.

And so sometimes what I notice is in the transcript, I'm getting the paragraph, but sometimes two different people are speaking. It's like one person is the first half of the paragraph and then person two will speak and then person one speaks again. But I see in Rev it's all just like one long paragraph and I almost want there to be a way where I can split it up and say like, oh, this is a gap where the other person talked. Let's say there's a paragraph that is four sentences, sentences one, three and four are John Smith sentence number two is Peter Smith, but on the Rev transcript it's showing up as just one person.

So I asked my wife, who works at a mid-size, she's also an attorney, works at a mid-sized defense firm. And they defend public entities, school districts, some local governments, and also big box stores. And their practice is very litigation intensive. So I asked my wife, I said, you know, I can sit here for three hours transcribing a 30 minute video. I'm like, what do you guys do? Do you have a person? Do you have a service? And this is I'd have to go back and look. But this is at least 3 or 4 years ago, maybe even longer. And she's like, oh, we use this company called Rev. It's just like online. So my understanding of the company at that time was that it was like a person doing it somewhere in the world. And so I uploaded the video and paid whatever it was and got it back in, like, like, no, like couple hours, I think. Or maybe the next day. And it was not perfect, but it was very good. And most importantly, to save me time, it identified Officer one. Officer two and it caught the name of the this person that was speaking and that person that was speaking. So it said, like this person said this. And then officer two said that and blah, blah, blah. And so I was like, wow, that's like crazy. And it worked out really well in that case. And to be honest, I didn't have occasion to use it for a long while. And then I more recently used it also for police body worn video.

And the court will give you, if you need another four weeks to get the most together, whatever it is. So time is speed is cool, but it's not really.

Maybe then I would say speed. And as far as data security and compliance, you know, I don't have institutional clients. So my clients, the person accused of, you know, getting in the stabbing or the robbery or whatever it is. So, you know, we very much are, you know, confidential and all that, but. Although now that I'm thinking about it, when they give us the body worn video or dash cam video from the police, we do enter into a stipulation. What do they call it? They have like a it's the penal code as a name for it. But you know that that information cannot be by law, cannot be disclosed. So I yeah, I guess data security is important because if for some crazy reason, like a piece of video I uploaded were to like come out on the internet or something, that that would be very bad.

Unknown_Ben Evenstad_4_1,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because a lot of times, you know, if there's I had a domestic violence case recently where there was six officers on scene and in discovery, we got the body worn of all of them, and all in total, it wound up being three hours or something. And a lot of it was duplicative because there's two officers interviewing one person. So you get both videos. So it's like kind of like waste of time. Again, going back to my time being somewhat valuable, I don't want to sit there for three hours and go over all that. So the summaries, if the summaries have time stamps and it says at 12 minutes and 50s, the officer number one is talking to this person. Then I can go in and watch, like kind of focus in on that part myself.

I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great.

So, I was wondering if there is a way, like, let's say I'm using my iPad, to somehow connect it so that it doesn't record the noise coming out of my speakers so it can record directly. 'Cause sometimes it will be better if I can put my headphones on and still have it recorded. But if I do that, it'll just pick up my voice and not the sound of the depo, or the sound of the Zoom call. So, I'm wondering if there is a way, if... Maybe I'm just... Maybe I didn't read the instructions, or if there's something that can be built later on.
