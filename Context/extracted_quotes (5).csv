Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_1_1,"I was introduced to Rev probably maybe three years ago. When it was. It was something before it was Rev, right? AI. The AI version for transcription. That's it. Yeah. So I started using it when it was Temi. Right.",Product Features,How long have you been using Rev?,IVW-00105,,,,
Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_1_2,"Right now we use it for transcription of taped conversations with either our experts. I've used it calls with witnesses, just rather than take notes, record it, and then have Rev transcribe it for our files. We use it for, we had a client who had taken some voice notes during a meeting with a doctor at a hospital. And we transcribed those. So that's primarily what I'm using Rev for.",Product Features,For what work do you use it right now?,IVW-00105,,,,
Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_1_3,"We would save it to we have case management software that we use, we use Neos as our case management system. And we'll add it to the memos file in there. It's all digital. We move it around, we might attach it to an email to somebody and say, hey, here are the notes from conversation with Doctor Jones. He reviewed our case and that sort of thing. I, I don't I'm sure I would I haven't had the chance to do it yet, but it would certainly be helpful when drafting expert reports that are case filings to go back to those notes, maybe copy and paste some of the wording in my report to help with the outline of a report. Yeah.",Process,"When you get the transcription back, what do you do with it?",IVW-00105,,,,
Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_1_4,"So I primarily work with medical malpractice and personal injury cases. And specifically in medical malpractice cases, we have to find an expert in the same field of medicine as the doctor that we're suing. To say that there was negligence and violations of standards of care. That's the number one thing we have to do to prove our case. So generally and these are medical heavy stuff. I know some stuff about medicine, not a lot. So we tend to record conversations with these physicians that review the cases for us, review the records and say, oh, Doctor Jones missed this on the x ray and this is what happened and what he should have done, etc., etc.. And then later in the case we have to file with the court a report saying this is what our expert is going to say at trial. And they have to be pretty thorough. And so what I would expect that I would do, if I had a transcription from one of those calls with our expert, I would go back to that in order to draft that report and maybe copy and paste some stuff from that transcription into the report, that sort of thing.",Product Features,Can you help me understand that use case and if there's anything Rev could do to make that easier?,IVW-00105,,,,

Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_2_2,"Betty Behrens: Well, certainly with we're still trying to find the perfect solution for summarizing medical records. You know, you've got somebody who, I don't know, like a chest x ray that isn't read, right. And then later down the line, they're found to have lung cancer or something. I need to find some system that can take these literally hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages of records and pull out and prepare a chronology of care. I need somebody who can take all those bills and make a nice spreadsheet of dates of service and what that cost and subtotals and totals. I haven't found that yet. Sure. In a in a manageable format.",Integration,Would it be useful if Rev integrated into any of those tools you mentioned?,IVW-00105,Closed Won,Nacelawgroup,Betty Behrens,2025-05-21
Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_2_3,Betty Behrens: Accuracy would have to be the most important. Cost would have to be in their data security. And.

Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_2_4,"Betty Behrens: We used EvenUp, and we are no longer using EvenUp. We did not. I personally didn't use them, but the attorneys and the firm have, they were not happy with the work product. And the time I think it took EvenUp to do that. And then they, like, totally flaked out on us at one point. And we had some projects with them, and then they just went off the radar and we had to hunt them down. Yeah, it was not a good parting. Soup.io has been trying to contact us. I think they were a sponsor of, like, on injury board, which is what we're, members of. I think they sponsored some webinar or something. But I haven't tried. I've heard of Scipio, but we haven't worked with them. No.",Decision Making,Have you evaluated any tools like Soup.io or EvenUp?,IVW-00105,Closed Won,Nacelawgroup,Betty Behrens,2025-05-21
Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_3_3,"Betty Behrens: I can't really think of anything specific. If I were to say if it could be more streamlined, then it would be more on the medical side, just in terms of trying to organize all those records and get them in in a way that's easy to go through, which is, I mean, what we use in our legal practice. But, I can't think of anything legal wise. I mean, maybe that would be something for firms that do sort of mass tort stuff that have just reams and reams of documents, organizing that sort of like discovery process. That would certainly be helpful. We don't have that.",Product Features,Is there anything about Rev that would be more legal specific that could be baked into the product?,IVW-00105,Closed Won,Nacelawgroup,Betty Behrens,2025-05-21
Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_3_4,"Betty Behrens: So. I'm, I think I'm the only one currently using Rev in my firm. I know that Chris Nace, the managing partner, he tends to record his calls when he's. We use zoom for our phone system. So when he's talking to the experts, I think zoom has a feature to summarize the call. I don't know that they record it, but I think they do an I summary. And we refer back to those notes when we're on the topic on the case, they're not very good because they're missing nuance. Right. That's why a transcription is, much more effective for what we want. And then. Yeah, we don't do much with them except internal use. We're looking at them as the case is progressing when we need to know what our experts opinions are going to be, we're not sharing them with the other side. We're not sharing them even with other witnesses in the case, because it's all discoverable and you don't want to do that. So it really is sort of like a, a work product. That we do, I used it recently to transcribe those voice notes that our client had given us. We ultimately gave the other side, the other attorneys, the actual voice notes, but we did not provide the transcription. That's that's for our use. Really? They they can pay for their own transcription if they want.",Product Features,"Is it just you at the firm who's using Rev, and how does it actually work?",IVW-00105,Closed Won,Nacelawgroup,Betty Behrens,2025-05-21

Nacelawgroup_Betty Behrens_4_2,"Would it be useful if whatever you use to record calls automatically synced up with Rev?
Betty Behrens: Yeah, definitely. Absolutely. Definitely. And again, since we don't ever use those out of office, their work product, it wouldn't be any sort of laws being broken by, I guess it wouldn't even be recording it, would it? I don't I don't know how that would work, but it doesn't seem to me that it would be any sort of law breaking thing, like I'm recording this conversation.

Betty Behrens: Yeah, I'd have to again sort of poke around and see what's there now. Again, I would love I'm also I'm not an Excel person at all, so I find very challenging to actually create sort of a spreadsheet of medical bills, which is something we always have to produce in our cases.

Betty Behrens: That's yeah, that all those things that's and that's where I learn it. I am on this paralegal committee with the injury board. And every month a bunch of paralegals get on a zoom conference and we have a topic usually like, oh, how are you handling this? And that's where we sort of share with each other. Oh, hey, have you guys tried Rev for this? Or Rev will go to injury board and say, hey, we're willing to put on a webinar about our product or DC trial lawyers just did a case debrief, for a significant jury verdict that came out. And I was on that and that was sponsored by somebody, obviously.
