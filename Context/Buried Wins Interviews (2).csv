Drew Giovannoli: What prompted an evaluation of a tool like Rev? Were you using something else beforehand or was it a new tool for the company?
Cyrus Nazarian: I think I'm the only one that's really using it right now, so I wouldn't say it's for the firm yet. I've been using it and to test it out and see if it's something that I should push to have more widespread adoption. But part of it for me is that historically, either we need to find a vendor who we send files to, and then they do human transcription services, and it takes time. It's expensive. And I would rather, while doing an investigation, upload a series of videos, audio files, and then within minutes, have audio transcription, an actual transcript ready. And have it mostly be. I mean, accuracy is important with this. So every time I've used it, I've needed to go through and edit, do some extensive editing. Because we need as faithful a recreation as possible. Faithful transcription as possible. So yeah. I think it's the speed and expense that really turned me on to it. Yeah, it lets me just get work done in a more timely manner instead of waiting and then checking emails with some other service and be like, is it ready yet? It's frustrating.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you mind touching on any of the areas specifically that you've used transcription for?
Cyrus Nazarian: So in the work that we do, we have, some of the first things I use this for was a 911 call. 911 call, audio file. That was an interview conducted by an insurance company of our client. So I wanted to understand, okay, what was without having to rehear or then transcribe the 911 call or the interview, know exactly what was said and by whom. Also used it for interviews conducted of a criminal defendant by law enforcement. Using that was originally on body worn camera footage. So it was some lengthy interviewing and I wanted to have that just memorialized. I've written and during a case evaluation we are collecting facts, all the facts we possibly can. So for preserving or understanding what the facts are and not having to just rewatch audio or listen to a story, rewatch video, or listen to audio. This is nice because then you have keyword search and you can get summaries and go from there for understanding the whole factual universe of the case.
Drew Giovannoli: When you went to find a vendor, did you already know about Rev, or did you look at a few different vendors online through search?
Cyrus Nazarian: I first learned to read from a prior firm I was with and then I did some research on Rev and its competitors. I can't remember the name of any competitors, but from what I was able, what I recall is that you guys were quite competitive with the rest of the field, and I generally like the layout and how the workflow goes, so I thought that was cool.
Drew Giovannoli: Speed and cost were your top two priority. And you just mentioned layout as kind of a nice to have something that made you feel comfortable in it. Were there any other criteria that you evaluated when comparing Rev to other vendors?
Cyrus Nazarian: Well, accuracy is important. The accuracy was one of the. So speed cost accuracy. And because ultimately less accuracy is less speed. So you can spit out a transcript really fast. But if I still have to go and spend, you know, 45 minutes on an hour long interview to make sure that everything that's in the transcript is accurately reflects what was said, then, you know, that's not ideal. I've had to do that. But so I don't know how I don't know how your product compares in accuracy to others.
Drew Giovannoli: When it comes to the transcription work they had done, were there any needs or even criteria that were specific to legal? We should be aware of formatting, for example, or any way that you looked at data. Obviously accuracy is important, but anything specific to legal.
Cyrus Nazarian: I'd say because say for instance, we have a transcript of a we uploaded an audio file of a recording of a medical examination. Is your is Rev SOC two compliant, HIPAA compliant. So privacy considerations are definitely important. In the legal context so that we don't inadvertently divulge attorney client privilege communications or violate our privacy rights in medical records or otherwise. That's quite important.
Drew Giovannoli: Yeah, I mean, I am third party to Rev. I do know their SOC two type two compliant. They're HIPAA compliant, PCI compliant. But I don't have the full details on that.
Cyrus Nazarian: Yeah SOC two. Yes. That's what it is. Sorry I don't know too much about that. I've just been told that that's what that's what we that's what we need. Right. What does what does SOC two compliance even mean?
Drew Giovannoli: I think that's to do with the way you handle data about people, their personal information and anything you're learning about them. Security. Standard. Security.
Cyrus Nazarian: Yeah. You know, I think I've looked at that and it seemed to satisfy our needs, so I didn't I didn't seem to have any issues with it. I think I like that there are the time stamps that you can have line by line time stamps so that you can be very sure of, you know, pinpointing exactly where an audio file, something was said. I like the speaker labels. I don't know that that there's anything specific to the legal field that is like a feature that other people wouldn't want. But yeah, data and privacy features are very important. Oh, video. So if we're taking if we're showing, like, body worn camera footage as an exhibit at trial, we want to be able to add subtitles to that so that it'll assist the jury in understanding what is being said, and want to be able to edit it so that what is showing up is actually what is being said.
Drew Giovannoli: And do you use Rev for that?
Cyrus Nazarian: I've tried. I don't know that. I don't think I had the best results with it. Let's see. Transcript. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I've played I've done, four minute and 52nd video of body worn camera footage with it. And I don't know that. Was I able to download the video with the subtitles? That's the If I was able to do that. So. Yeah. How do. Same. Time. So I'm seeing that I can download the transcript, but I don't know how to download the video with the. Yeah. I couldn't figure out how to download the video with the subtitles in it.
Drew Giovannoli: How did Rev do on these items? Like how did do they meet your expectations on these items fall short. Did they exceed.
Cyrus Nazarian: Speed I think exceeded my expectations. But the thing is, like, I would sacrifice speed for better accuracy. Gladly. If it took twice as long. Three times as like, I think it's done like a 45 minute file audio file in like seven minutes. Even if it took an hour, I'd be happy to to to sacrifice speed for accuracy. Yeah. Costs, I think is fine, right? It's fine. Because if it were with the given, with the current accuracy, I'd have a hard time justifying a greater cost because of how much work I've had to do. Editing the transcript to have it be a faithful transcript. So I think sacrificing speed in the interest of accuracy at the current cost would make sense. But if in future there's a way to. So yeah, speed exceeded my expectations. Cost my expectations. Accuracy fell below my expectations. Data security and compliance met expectations. Ease of use. Once I figured out how, you know, double clicking that you can essentially treat it like a word doc. Kind of ease of use more or less met my expectations, maybe just a little bit under under my expectations. And then, I don't know, I, I guess I'd have to know what specific features you'd be referring to to, I guess specific features. Let's see. So if we were to download okay, this is cool how you have the inline captions columns. And then I like that they're a word doc and PDF and text file that you can export. Highlighted sections only include inline timestamps. I like those features I guess, expectations with regard to specific features.
Drew Giovannoli: With accuracy rating so high. Are there any files where it would be worth it to upgrade to a human transcriptionist first for accuracy purposes?
Cyrus Nazarian: So that's something that I haven't done yet. It's something that I believe I would do if I was I was planning on doing that for a case. I was going to head to trial, but it resolved, so there's no need to anymore. But I, I was curious when it comes to getting a human transcription. What is Rev's litigation support and ensuring that whoever did the transcription can provide like an attestation, like an affidavit or attestation or declaration or appear for, for the purposes of trial to authenticate the transcript.
Drew Giovannoli: I don't know the answer to that, but I can get an answer to it. And I think just the your question is going to be valuable to them to know that, like if you were to do what I'm hearing is if you were to do human or pay for it, you would need them to be able to do what you just said.
Cyrus Nazarian: Yeah. It'd be we'd need to. Let's see. Contagious. Yeah, I guess it would be. Part of it would be establishing a chain of custody. We would. So on one hand, say we were doing, I think sailor body body cam footage would use the officer who had the body worn camera footage to authenticate the video was taken by him or her, and then in the if if we. For whatever reason, we ended up using a transcript of that the audio and the body worn camera footage. We would need to establish that part of the chain of custody that was then sent to this person who did the the transcription. Yeah. But in most cases we would we would play the video, but ideally it would have faithful captions.
Drew Giovannoli: And just so I understood, you mentioned before about, you know, if you confirmed it, that the person who performed the transcriptions would potentially need to be available for the court case to show up and attest to the transcription.
Cyrus Nazarian: I've never seen that done, but I think having I think being able to provide us. Because you can do it by testimony. I think, like an affidavit should suffice of like I am. You know, this is my name on this date. I was provided with this file. This file name I transcribed, transcribed it. Here's a copy of the transcription. It's my license number. Whatever the case is. So I think that would probably suffice.
Drew Giovannoli: If they had that, if they had affidavits for any human transcription work, would you find it a tool that could be useful to you?
Cyrus Nazarian: Yeah, it's a request like that. It's it come with an affidavit signed by the person who did the transcription. That would be helpful.
Drew Giovannoli: Would it make you use human transcription more?
Cyrus Nazarian: I don't not at the not necessarily at the initial like, investigation stage. If for whatever reason, it made sense to use a transcription in lieu of the original, of playing the original audio or video file at trial, then yes. So it wouldn't It'd be nice to have. I don't know that it would. It if that were a requirement before heading to trial and it were available through Rev. That would prevent us from having to go somewhere else to do it.
Drew Giovannoli: Any more questions about the use? You told me what you got transcriptions of, but what do you do with the transcriptions after you've received them?
Cyrus Nazarian: I I read through them. I read through them. To collect information from them about the facts of the accident. I mean, I get quite a bit when I'm going editing the transcript while watching or listening to the file. But I use it in case evaluations. I use it in building the factual background of the case, fleshing that out. I use it to collect witness statements. Again, for factual background, which will then let me do a liability analysis, get an idea of injuries.
Drew Giovannoli: Are you using any other tools alongside Rev like, do you copy and paste it into Google or a Microsoft word or any other software in the law space like Clio or.
Cyrus Nazarian: I haven't yet, no.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you, do you read through them in Rev or do you move them to like a word doc?
Cyrus Nazarian: I think for me, the ones that I've edited, I by the time I've read through it, I have a pretty good grasp of what's going on. That I don't really need to read through the transcript once it's produced. But I do print it and save it, and we'll then send it to Extended to other attorneys with my evaluation and saying, hey, this is what's in here. Here's a quick summary. And this this is I will, I'll do is say, you know, that this person A stated this at the three minute 32nd mark, and I'll cite to it so that they can go back and either watch the video or review the transcript or both.
Drew Giovannoli: I'd love to hear anything, any challenges or frustrations you feel while using Rev things you'd like them to improve for better serve a company like yours or better serve you.
Cyrus Nazarian: It's just better accuracy of like, with the AI generated ones. So I don't know how many times it goes through it or tries to recognize. But if there were better accuracy with the AI transcription, that would be huge, because I feel like with the human transcription, while it will be more accurate, it just takes longer.
Drew Giovannoli: There's like a length of time. If they said humans done in two hours, one hour, six hours.
Cyrus Nazarian: I mean, for human transcription. Well, that's the thing is, like if to have human transcription done in a matter of like a, like a few hours, I feel like the cost is going to be significant. So in most cases we don't have it's not that pressing. If I could have something done. Like with the AI transcription, I don't need a 45. I typically don't need a 45 minute File to be ready in seven minutes. Like if I. Like an hour, I think or less. Or 14 minutes. 21 minutes, I don't know. However, extra amount of time is required to make sure that it's more accurate for human transcription. I think us being able to have it similar to like us like being able to email my paralegal and saying, hey, do you think that you can have this transcribed by end of day tomorrow? That that would be cool to have maybe like a 24 to 48 hour turnaround on a human. Transcription.
Drew Giovannoli: What are the current turnaround times for transcription?
Cyrus Nazarian: And essentially, are they doing what I. What I have been doing with the first, the first run through is, using AI, and then they'll go through and check it for accuracy and make edits as necessary.
Drew Giovannoli: That's right. So they have a process where they get a first pass done by AI, and then they have people who do transcription as a profession looking through for to edit it up to 99% accuracy.
Cyrus Nazarian: Yeah. Yeah, I think I saw I think I've let's see. So like this. One. Let's see. Okay. So we have a. Audio file. Solid. Hour and four minutes. Let's see. I like that. That it gives you the pricing, the services right here. So, 65 minutes. Human. Transcript. Dollar 93 per minute with the 3% subscription discount. The thing is, like, one thing I guess is a bit of a gripe is that the. I feel like the different levels of membership, I feel like should be a reflection of the amount of time that you need, like the anticipated number of minutes or hours of transcription that you'll need and that. That should make the difference in the price. But whether you have the lower number of minutes or the higher number of minutes, I feel like the discount on human transcripts and human captions that the discounts for subscriptions should be the same. It's like it just seems. It just seems silly to me that someone who just needs more time will get a greater discount. We're paying for something. We're paying for less time. I feel like we should get the same discount. So that when we do elect to go for the human involved services that it's, you know, it feels more equitable than like here. We know you don't need a thousand or whatever, 6000 minutes, but pay for it. And that's the only way you get a subscription. Discount is greater than the 3% for the for less because like we've had this for I think a couple of months now and I haven't gone anywhere near the max at all. So there's no reason to get a better subscription level than to get the discount. But then even with the discount, it doesn't offset the additional cost enough.
Drew Giovannoli: Sure, that makes sense. Yes. It's like for the basic plan, the dollar 70 for human versus $1.40 or dollar 39. That's what, $0.31 a minute. So you'd have to use what, 31 100 hours to get 30 bucks saved for it to make sense. So probably 60 to 100 hours or 60 to 100 minutes.
Cyrus Nazarian: There's no way we're doing I'm doing that kind of volume.

Transcript
Drew: If you don't mind, I'd love to just have you introduce yourself for the record and your role.
Brian: Sure. So I am an attorney in Massachusetts. I do criminal defense for kids. So what that means is that my clients are charged with committing a crime between the ages of 12 and 18 and they are tried in juvenile court in Massachusetts. Juvenile court has jurisdiction over almost any type of case and could range from trespassing and disorderly conduct on the less serious side all the way up to attempted murder, rape, and home invasion. On the other end, the only type of case, criminal case that does not go to juvenile court is murder. That's adult court only.
Drew: Got it. And it's your firm, correct?
Brian: Correct. It's just me. I'm the only one.
Drew: How did you come across Rev? What prompted the need to look for a service like that?
Brian: So I've had a subscription with Westlaw for a decade and I got co-counsel AI a couple of years ago. And one of the things that I really needed done was transcribing videos, so like body cam, police communications, radio communications, interviews, and I needed it done quick. So if I send it to a transcriber, some transcribers, they don't want to do body cam work at all because it's hard to understand. And then if I'm sending out a recorded interview where the quality of the audio is better, it still could take a month. And I am a trial court attorney. So what that means is I am in front of the judge a lot and sometimes my clients are arrested and I don't have time to wait a month for stuff to come in. So I just was talking with my AI and it said, I may even ask the question, can I upload a video and have it transcribed? I knew I couldn't do it when I first got it, but then the answer recommended like Rev and then some other one. And so I looked at them both. I don't remember what the other one was, but I tried Rev and I did the trial or the free account, whatever it was, and I was like, oh, this is awesome. I can just upload a video and it gives me a transcript right away. I just loved the interaction and how it works. So it took me two days to be like, I need to just sign up for a pay subscription.
Drew: Do you use just the AI functionality or do you ever use the human accurate level?
Brian: So far I've only used the AI, so what I primarily am doing is anytime I get the prosecution gives me body cam police videos, any surveillance video with audio, 911 calls, so anything audio or video, I just upload it and then play around with the transcript function. So instead of speaker one, I change it to the names and then I start to ask it questions. I'm still using my co-counsel AI for the majority of my AI stuff, but I'm using Rev to produce the transcripts and then ask questions specific to the transcripts.
Drew: Can you break down for me how you used AI with Westlaw and co-counsel and then what you found value in using AI for with Rev?
Brian: Yeah, so the AI I have through Westlaw co-counsel, there's two main parts that I use it for. One is the legal research. So instead of doing, do you know what Westlaw is?
Drew: It's a Thomson Reuters AI software. I know that, but I haven't used it.
Brian: Yeah, so Westlaw is, it's almost like Google for lawyers, but instead of the internet, it's like case law. So 50 years ago you'd have to go to a law library and look up cases and laws and books and Westlaw has everything digitized. So you can search statutes, case law decisions, like all that stuff in their Westlaw database. And so what it used to be just a regular search word, you search a term you put and or you put parentheses and use that awkward language to try and find what you're looking for. But now with the AI, you can just ask it a question like, Hey, here's my scenario. My client's charged with assault and battery dangerous weapon and he's wearing Crocs. Are crocs a dangerous weapon or can you find cases that talk about what a dangerous weapon is? And the AI works through the Westlaw database, so it will scan all the cases and then highlight stuff for me. So it really makes my research much, much more effective and really speeds things up for me. And then the second part of the AI that they have is you can use it to brainstorm cases. So for example, I'll say like, Hey, this is a self-defense case and I'm going to upload all of the evidence I have and then I can ask you questions and I could say, okay, here's a police report. Here's grand jury minutes, here's a victim statement, here's all the evidence I have from the prosecution. Where did the victim say X? Where did the victim say Y? And so it can create charts and highlight things for me. I can also brainstorm with it. So I'll be like, Hey, this is self-defense, come up with 10 catchy phrases that I could use. So I have discussions like that, but the thing it wasn't doing was producing transcripts of body cam, so I would have to have a transcript done and then upload it. And that's where Rev comes in that I use Rev to produce the transcripts to then upload into co-counsel.
Drew: What are the types of questions you're asking the AI in Rev about the transcript?
Brian: So kind of like what I said, if I'm uploading a bunch of documents to co-counsel, when did this person say this? When did this person say this? And I'm doing the same thing with a body cam. When did the alleged victim say my client did something or name the description that identify all the descriptions that the victim or witness gave of my client or whatever. So I just kind of use it to highlight the portions that can be relevant to me.
Drew: Would it be helpful to you if there were any sort of templates or terms that were preset as you loaded files in that could make things more useful?
Brian: Yeah, so that's a really good example. So what I'd say, so in Massachusetts, and I assume every, I'll just speak to Massachusetts where I am, we have jury instructions for pretty much every type of offense you can have. And the jury instructions, it's basically like a checklist for the jury. So it's what the judge reads to the jury. So they say when assault and battery, it's any unlawful touching and these three things have to be present. It would be cool to kind of take all those jury instructions and then say like, Hey Rev, I'm uploading body cam from an assault and battery case. Where are these elements in place? So if it's an assault and battery and there's three elements, identify each statement that is element one or element two or element three, that'd be something that'd be kind of cool. And they'll just come from the jury instructions, which like I said are pretty standard in Massachusetts where they identify 1, 2, 3, and if you have these three things, it's an assault and battery.
Drew: Are there other tools you're using? You mentioned Westlaw, are you using a case management tool?
Brian: Yeah, I use My Case for case management. So My Case is cloud-based software that I can upload all my documents. So it's kind of like a file cabinet, a calendar tasks all in one thing. And I use that all the time. So My Case is my daily, I'm on that the most because that keeps track of everything. And then Westlaw for research for brainstorming and Rev for the transcripts.
Drew: Are there integrations that would be helpful from Rev into something else or something else into Rev?
Brian: So it'd be cool to have an integration between My Case and Rev. So for example, I upload a document to My Case, so My Case becomes my former physical folder, so it would have all my video files. Then what I do is I take those same documents and upload them into Rev. So I'm kind of doing the same thing in each platform, uploading it. It'd be cool if I could upload it one place and it appeared in both. I upload it in My Case and it automatically generates a transcript in Rev. That would be a cool feature rather than me having these two separate systems because what I do now in Rev, I create a new folder for basically every case, upload the documents to that case. And then the same thing with my Westlaw co-counsel, so that's like its own separate entity. So I have a separate case file with all the documents from Westlaw.
Drew: In the searching you're doing in Rev, are there ever documents that you wish you could use some of the AI searching to additional things beyond just the transcripts?
Brian: Yeah, I mean, would be nice to compare it to would be police reports. So sometimes a police report is a summary of the transcript, so the body cam is recording what's actually happening, the police officer's writing a summary. It'd be nice to have both of those together to compare. So for example, I would ask my AI a question like, Hey, what's the description in the police report? And then what the witness actually said, and maybe there's a difference and that'd be something that I'd want to know to compare those two.
Drew: If you had that every time you uploaded the body cam, you had the summary from the police, if it highlighted discrepancies every time you uploaded them, would that be helpful?
Brian: Yeah, something like that would be really helpful because a lot of times with a case I have to read carefully to highlight those discrepancies. So if there is AI that is doing that for me, that would speed things up tremendously. Sometimes the body cam is like four hours long because they turn it on at the start of the interaction and then they turn it off at the conclusion. And if it's a really intense case that's going on for a long time, you have these incredibly long videos. Also, if there's five officers responding and each one turns on the body cam, you're getting five versions of the same thing. So it can be very time consuming to go through that. And a lot more police departments are getting body cam, so the amount of information that I have to go through, it's getting pretty large.
Drew: You take the transcripts out of Rev, then you move it to My Case?
Brian: Yeah, so sometimes what I'll do is I'm manipulating it in Rev to get the transcript kind of how I want it, and then I will export it as a Word document or a PDF, and then maybe I'm putting that in My Case so I have a copy of the transcript that I can use or that I have to give to the prosecution or I'm uploading it to my Westlaw and then putting it with my other documents in there.
Drew: Is there anything about Rev that is challenging or frustrating?
Brian: Yeah, and I have this major caveat that I may be missing the obvious way to fix it. So let's say I upload a body cam and like I said, a lot of transcribers, they don't like body cam because there's people talking and their voices overlap. And so sometimes what I notice is in the transcript, I'm getting the paragraph, but sometimes two different people are speaking. It's like one person is the first half of the paragraph and then person two will speak and then person one speaks again. But I see in Rev it's all just like one long paragraph and I almost want there to be a way where I can split it up and say like, oh, this is a gap where the other person talked. Let's say there's a paragraph that is four sentences, sentences one, three and four are John Smith sentence number two is Peter Smith, but on the Rev transcript it's showing up as just one person. I want to be able to change that. So take out sentence two and have that be the next paragraph and then resume sentences three and four going back to John Smith.
Drew: You want the ability to go edit after?
Brian: Correct, correct. Yeah, correct.
Drew: Is there anything else Rev could do to strengthen their appeal to legal companies?
Brian: I mean the body cam thing is super helpful. The body cam 911 calls, being able to turn that around in minutes is so, so helpful. I think focusing in on incorporating other languages like Spanish where I am, I have a lot of Spanish speaking clients, so being able to use multiple languages and then I guess the editing features, like I just said, being able to really customize it and potentially also just continue to work on those customizations and maybe are there videos that can educate people how to use it better? Stuff like that would be helpful too.
Drew: Where do you go to learn about tools like this?
Brian: Yeah, for legal stuff, I do like legal topics. I'll go to seminars for all my technology stuff. I'll take a class here and there. My Case has a really good library of, we're going to do a seminar on this topic and so I can just go to their support page and learn the workflow skill. When I signed up for the Westlaw Co-counsel, they had a bunch of videos that I took to learn the basics and then once you go through the basics you can do more advanced stuff. So just like the training videos to learn how to do this stuff.
Drew: Let me just wrap and ask if there's anything about your experience that I didn't cover that could be useful to Rev to improve.
Brian: No, I'm really happy with it. I'm very impressed with how easy it is to use. I wish I found it way earlier.
Drew: That's great feedback.
Brian: I really do. There's so much body cam now and it's so much easier to interact with Rev and ask you questions to cut through. I'm not watching five hours or 15 hours. If it's three different officers that all had their body cam going, I can just narrow into the two minutes that I actually need from all the video.

Drew Giovannoli: Can you introduce yourself and your role at your organization?
Yusuf Elmarakby: My name is Yusuf. I'm currently a legal assistant at a law office here in Atlanta, Georgia. We are a private criminal defense firm. We oftentimes use Rev very frequently whenever we need to extract and review discovery that's sent to us from numerous institutions, district attorneys offices. It could be interviews, phone calls, surveillance footage, anything with audio that we need to put together with a transcription in order to narrow down exactly what we're hearing and seeing. We use Rev as much as possible.
Drew Giovannoli: How many people are at your organization?
Yusuf Elmarakby: There's seven. There's four attorneys and three legal assistants.
Drew Giovannoli: What prompted you to start using a service like Rev and when did you begin using it?
Yusuf Elmarakby: It's just a simple, tiresome act of having to watch surveillance footage and just writing down what they're saying for clarity. It's a lifesaver to use Rev to be able to just have a full transcription and go back and watch the video or listen to the call and match it up with what's being sent to us. It just saves a lot of time and efficiency and working on these people's cases and guaranteeing them the results that we're being retained to give. It gives us drastic improvements in analyzing evidence and being able to use our findings to either get it suppressed or whatever it is, it just helps us read and observe evidence better.
Drew Giovannoli: Was the company using Rev when you first got there or is it a newer tool?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I first arrived at my organization about two, two and a half years ago. And since then, the legal assistant that was here before me introduced me to Rev and its services. Before working here, I've never heard of Rev actually.
Drew Giovannoli: Can you talk about all the different things you might use Rev for in different types of cases?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Oftentimes we're sent a lot of body camera footage. Whenever we want to know what's being said by law enforcement or people that are interacting with law enforcement, sometimes it is very hard to hear through the body camera footage. Given that it's a small device, the audio that is captured is pretty faint. We kind of just want to know what's going on in the surveillance footage, or we want to read along with the video that we're watching just to make sure everything corroborates to the situation at hand and what's actually happening. We oftentimes use it when listening to phone calls when we want to know exactly what's happening because phone calls, sometimes people's voices go in and out or they're faint or they have an accent, or they're speaking too low or too loud. We just want to know exactly what's going on, because in the world of criminal justice, it is very scrutinizing and important to know what exactly is being said and what is being addressed.
Drew Giovannoli: How does your firm use Rev? Is it a tool that anybody can use?
Yusuf Elmarakby: We all are under one account. Whenever we need to create a file on a particular client and we submit a video or some audio under that client and kind of wait till the next day or whenever it comes back to us to download that Rev and attach it to the evidence in our files. So we all just access the same account and pay under our business card.
Drew Giovannoli: Are you using the AI or the human transcriptions?
Yusuf Elmarakby: We use the human transcriptions. We find them to be a bit more accurate. If we need it in a more timely manner, we've actually recently started using a different service called Turbo Scribe, which we've found the AI tool to be a little more efficient than Rev's. As far as the AI option with Rev, we found the human transcription to just be a lot more accurate and detailed.
Drew Giovannoli: You feel like Turbo Scribe is faster and more accurate than the AI from Rev?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Yes.
Drew Giovannoli: Currently you send the files that are more last minute to Rev or to Turbo Scribe?
Yusuf Elmarakby: We send the last minute files to Turbo Scribe. Rev is just whenever I need it, it comes. Rev is just the go to most accurate option in regards to human transcription.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you think the split of the workload is between Rev and Turbo Scribe?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I would say 70-30. Just for the simple fact that we get a lot of stuff last minute, man. Because we're kind of on the opposite side here. We're on the defense side. So they tend to have a little more leverage by just dumping stuff on us whenever they feel like it or things that we don't know that people are trying to introduce. They just kind of throw it at us last minute and we have to hurry up and go through it and make sure it's okay. Or should we object to them bringing in that type of evidence. We kind of need to analyze it a little quicker, which is why we jumped to Turbo Scribe.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you think there's any world in which you would move more work to Turbo Scribe because of cost or is the quality from human transcription still important?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I've actually found Turbo Scribe to be a little more cheaper. I don't know the exact difference in price per length, but I've found my totals to be a little bit cheaper with the AI and Turbo Scribe. Given that the human transcript on Rev is a little more expensive than the AI option as well. But it's just for the guarantee of the accuracy and the time. It's just a better price for the AI transcripts with Turbo Scribe. However, I'm not the one paying for it. Typically we're reimbursed by our clients for paying extra for other things. However it is good to just keep expenses at a minimum.
Drew Giovannoli: When did you start using Turbo Scribe?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I started we started using Turbo Scribe about a month and a half ago.
Drew Giovannoli: What did you do before Turbo Scribe for urgent requests?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Just always been using Rev.
Drew Giovannoli: Were you using the AI also for the fast stuff but just found Turbo Scribe faster and more accurate?
Yusuf Elmarakby: If something was a time issue, we would use the AI. But the results with human, the human transcript was just a lot better.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you feel like any of your needs are legal specific? Are there any needs that Rev needs to address that have to do with formatting or a certain way of doing business that is legal specific?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I honestly always use Rev for work. It's very important because what we use Rev for is for these people's lives. I mean, they're at stake, their cases, the future of how things will turn out for them and their matters depends on how accurate we view the evidence and Rev does that. Rev helps us out with that with the human transcripts and has allowed us to view evidence a lot more easier. I think it's a phenomenal platform that we have utilized very greatly. Outside of using it for work, I honestly can't say that I've used it much, but it is a very critical and necessary tool to observe and view evidence.
Drew Giovannoli: Is everyone using Rev at work or is it a certain group of users?
Yusuf Elmarakby: All of us. All of us, really.
Drew Giovannoli: After receiving the transcripts, do you have it in Microsoft Word or are you reviewing them as a team?
Yusuf Elmarakby: What we would do is once we receive the transcript, we would just make sure that the speaker notes are there, who's saying what. And then we just download it as a PDF just to read along with the evidence as we're viewing it.
Drew Giovannoli: What other software tools do you use at the law firm?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Adobe Acrobat helps us view evidence very easily, kind of move it around. We have heavily dependent on Google Calendar, kind of helps us manage our schedules for case management very easily. We have a software called MyCase.
Drew Giovannoli: Would it be useful if Rev was more integrated into any of the tools you just mentioned?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Yes. As well as Dropbox, we use Dropbox very greatly as well. Since all of our information is stored on a drive that is accessed through our office network server, a lot of times our attorneys are in court or they're out of town. We handle cases all over. Currently have an attorney out there in New York who's doing the case and whatever she needs to access information, she needs to go to the Dropbox, where we have a copy of all of our information that's stored in our network here at the office.
Drew Giovannoli: Is Rev integrated with any of those other tools or do you wish it was?
Yusuf Elmarakby: It is not. However, it's not hard for us to just move anything over. I mean, it would be very cool if every time we uploaded something to Rev for a specific client that the results would show up in that client's Dropbox folder, because every name just has their own folder in Dropbox. So if John Doe has a phone call that we need to Rev, if we send the phone call to Rev and the results were just added to John Doe's Dropbox folder, that would help tremendously.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there any challenges or frustrations you encounter with Rev that they could work on?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Rev is great. I honestly don't see any besides just the accuracy of the AI transcript having room for improvement. I honestly don't have any quarrel with Rev.
Drew Giovannoli: If Rev's AI accuracy improved, do you think you could win back the AI business from Turbo Scribe?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Yes. I mean, the only reason why Turbo Scribe is ahead, I feel like, is because it creates a transcript like right in front of you. You can watch the video, let's say it's an interview video and it will just fill itself out as you watch the video so you can watch the transcript happen in real time. I think that would be pretty cool with Rev.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you use any of the AI functionalities to ask questions about the transcript?
Yusuf Elmarakby: No, I have not.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you use AI in any other role?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I honestly have not. I use AI in general just for editing something that I've already written out. I use ChatGPT, check grammar, make sure something's concise or just maintaining the same tone and flow. But besides that, I don't really try not to use it as a search engine of any type of sort because I don't know where I read this at, but I just don't want to pollute the environment by using too much AI for a lot of different things. I don't want to create that habit.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there any legal specific features you could think would be valuable? Whether it's better templating features or self-service support that you need?
Yusuf Elmarakby: Not off the top of my head. Because as far as our particular needs for Rev, it does what we need it to. We honestly just need to read and see what is being heard or played from whatever we send over and it does that job. I mean, honestly, we have no complaints.
Drew Giovannoli: Outside of the speed of Turbo Scribe, is there anything else that they could learn from Turbo Scribe in terms of the way they present the information?
Yusuf Elmarakby: I actually like the format of the results from Rev a lot more. I feel like Rev is a lot more accurate in naming the speakers as well as who's saying what and just splitting up the conversations that are being had. Rev does a lot better job at doing that. Turbo Scribe we use it more just because of how cheap it is, how efficient and quick. But we always have to go back and edit who the speakers are for Turbo Scribe. So presentation wise I still think that Rev is on top, but for a matter of efficiency Turbo Scribe may be in the lead.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything else that comes to mind for Rev that they would benefit from learning about to improve whether it's people, process or product?
Yusuf Elmarakby: People process and product is great. I mean process as far as process, sometimes it just takes a little long. And honestly, as long as I get accurate results, I don't necessarily have any problem with that. But if it was to be any quicker, I mean, that's just better for everybody. Time is money and a lot of these people time isn't something that they have, the people that we work with.",Interview with Yusuf Elmarakby.txt (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/43/43/1752724800000/j_uON5sNB6fsOX22c_OpDg/F5JyhyTHCK2FuIa4H12Q4LCxhMIA5RoY1YW8ZNG9expXSAI1ScFe1NPLxBP-JNkbyu6d7CRtuLn6X27e81DZA28nfrHf4d4b98bVffkjNoBP5VF5NvPh0q1qzBYNL0RzSiqeLZ72kV8uNuB0lATiL8KtmMOjYooqi8eeJwoPP0f1YuMEkbliAD6TJtBfHK0z/XqsgMr_ZG_Ar_0DbHIyT2bm2_I8UX8ZdIni0WhFho_c)

Transcript
Nick Delgado: Can you briefly talk about your role in the firm?
Ben Evenstad: I'm a solo practice. I'm in my 10th year. I'm kind of a one man shop. I have freelance paralegal that I use. And I also have an attorney that's a kind of a ghostwriter that does some of the more technical oppositions. Like, if there's a motion for summary judgment and we need to do an opposition, it's very intensive. And sometimes I find that using a ghostwriter is a better use of my time. So besides the ghostwriter and the paralegal freelance, I'm pretty much a one man show.
Nick Delgado: What prompted you to evaluate transcription services like Rev?
Ben Evenstad: I had a criminal case where there was a lot of body worn video. And I needed a transcription. And there was, like, I forget how long it was, but it was like, at least 30 minutes and different people talking. So I asked my wife, who works at a mid-size, she's also an attorney, works at a mid-sized defense firm. And they defend public entities, school districts, some local governments, and also big box stores. And their practice is very litigation intensive. So I asked my wife, I said, you know, I can sit here for three hours transcribing a 30 minute video. I'm like, what do you guys do? Do you have a person? Do you have a service? And this is I'd have to go back and look. But this is at least 3 or 4 years ago, maybe even longer. And she's like, oh, we use this company called Rev. It's just like online. So my understanding of the company at that time was that it was like a person doing it somewhere in the world. And so I uploaded the video and paid whatever it was and got it back in, like, like, no, like couple hours, I think. Or maybe the next day. And it was not perfect, but it was very good. And most importantly, to save me time, it identified Officer one. Officer two and it caught the name of the this person that was speaking and that person that was speaking. So it said, like this person said this. And then officer two said that and blah, blah, blah. And so I was like, wow, that's like crazy. And it worked out really well in that case. And to be honest, I didn't have occasion to use it for a long while. And then I more recently used it also for police body worn video. And I think it was AI this time that was doing it or automated that was doing it. So that's kind of my experience with Rev is just those two times.
Nick Delgado: Going into the process, what expectations did you have for how the service would support you?
Ben Evenstad: So I had earlier in my career, I had transcribed videos myself, and I'm a very fast typer. But the issue with transcribing is you still need to deposit every, you know, 10s to catch up or whatever. And if you need to put like an ellipses in there or whatever you need to do, it's like just I really it just takes so much time, and I was willing. I mean, don't tell them this, but I was willing to pay anything to, like, not have to sit there and do that. So to get like, a reliable transcript of a piece of video for a fairly nominal cost. It was like such a huge help. And I've talked to older attorneys where they would have to have their like, you know, support staff do it, or I think there used to be like court reporter services that could also do transcriptions from different videos. And I don't know what they paid back then, but I know what court reporters still cost today, and it's insane. So I don't know if this answers the question, but just to have that transcription like ability and quick. And the cost is in the right zone. That's like. Yeah, that's why I love the service.
Nick Delgado: Have you evaluated any other vendors since using Rev?
Ben Evenstad: I think when I was first asking my wife about it, I think I just did a Google search and saw a few different ones. But before I even started looking into those, she had already told me about Rev. So I was kind of first one I went with.
Nick Delgado: In thinking about the service, did you have criteria for evaluation?
Ben Evenstad: So, you know, accuracy is, you know, that's what you want. So I don't know if you're familiar with this, but when a video is shown, let's say, in front of a jury at trial, let's say, you provide the jury with a transcript of what's in the video, and the judge instructs the jury that the transcription is not evidence. Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid. Like kind of follow along and in my experience, it's been like kind of 1 or 2 page like short transcripts, but I've heard of trials where they're going to watch a 45 minute video and they read the transcript. And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show. I don't know if a mid-size or larger firm wouldn't care as much about this, but, you know, I don't have, you know, besides my paralegal, I don't have a support staff. So my time is kind of the most valuable thing. If the transcription can be accurate and not require me to, like, go back over it and fill in a ton of stuff. Then it's just saving me time. And that's like, that's the game changer for me. It's like it has to. I want to think of as little as possible about a transcript. I just want to have the finished product.
Nick Delgado: I have different criteria and I'm wondering if you can rank them. We have speed, cost, accuracy, data security, compliance, ease of use, specific features. What would be most important?
Ben Evenstad: I would go three then two. Speed, I told you earlier, like I was first time I used I was like, surprised how fast it came back. For the most part, you know, it's whether it's criminal litigation or civil litigation. And I'll just speak for Los Angeles, where I practice. You have a lot of time. And the court will give you, if you need another four weeks to get the most together, whatever it is. So time is speed is cool, but it's not really. If something took a week, that wouldn't really matter to me generally. So I would say accuracy. Number one. Cost number two. Ease of use I would probably say is my third top one. Maybe then I would say speed. And as far as data security and compliance, you know, I don't have institutional clients. So my clients, the person accused of, you know, getting in the stabbing or the robbery or whatever it is. So, you know, we very much are, you know, confidential and all that, but. Although now that I'm thinking about it, when they give us the body worn video or dash cam video from the police, we do enter into a stipulation. What do they call it? They have like a it's the penal code as a name for it. But you know that that information cannot be by law, cannot be disclosed. So I yeah, I guess data security is important because if for some crazy reason, like a piece of video I uploaded were to like come out on the internet or something, that that would be very bad. So that's important. But again, I don't like I don't represent governments. So it's not and then specific features. I guess I would have to know what those were.
Nick Delgado: How much of your evaluation needs would you say is specific to the legal industry?
Ben Evenstad: Well, I mean, good question. I guess, you know, my wife again, at a, like, at a bigger firm, She might have a different like prioritization of those things, but accuracy. I would be if you were talking to people in the legal world, I if accuracy was not number one for pretty much everyone, I would be surprised. If there was a lower cost option, but it made me have to go back and go over it all over again to make it more accurate. I wouldn't want to do that. I'd rather pay more to be accurate the first time. So I think accuracy would be like in the legal world would be absolute number one. And then I think cost would be number two, and then those other ones would probably be distributed. However after that.
Nick Delgado: Did anything stand out from Rev compared to your expectations going into the process?
Ben Evenstad: Well, like I said, I was surprised at again that first time I used it when it was a human. I was surprised again at how quick it was and how and how good it was. I'm trying to. I don't want to confuse something I used Rev for with something I used Dropbox for, because I know Dropbox has. If you have, if you upload a video to Dropbox and then click like give me a summary, it'll tell you like this is a police. It's like it's not a transcription, but it's like, this is a police interaction between a male officer and a female officer and a subject who, you know, blah, blah, blah. And it'll kind of give you like, a breakdown. I think the last time I used Rev, they had some kind of I thought they had some kind of summary of what was happening. And again, sorry if I'm confusing this for for the Dropbox service, but I remember thinking wow, in a couple of years this will be so amazing because it will be so accurate and right. But as far as like the transcription itself. And again, sorry, I'm like going all over the place, but. The first time I used Rev when it was a human doing it, I found that it was more accurate than the most recent time I used it for transcription when I think it was the computer or AI or whatever, and it was not as accurate.
Nick Delgado: You mentioned that summary. Summary quality not where you'd like it to be now. But is that something as a feature that you see value in if the quality was to be improved?
Ben Evenstad: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because a lot of times, you know, if there's I had a domestic violence case recently where there was six officers on scene and in discovery, we got the body worn of all of them, and all in total, it wound up being three hours or something. And a lot of it was duplicative because there's two officers interviewing one person. So you get both videos. So it's like kind of like waste of time. Again, going back to my time being somewhat valuable, I don't want to sit there for three hours and go over all that. So the summaries, if the summaries have time stamps and it says at 12 minutes and 50s, the officer number one is talking to this person. Then I can go in and watch, like kind of focus in on that part myself. So kind of having like a little roadmap super helpful, but I'm like, I read like a lot of stuff about AI and kind of where we're going with all that. And I'm not an expert by any means, but I can imagine that in a couple of years or whenever that it will be insanely accurate and it will be able to tell you, like, not only, you know, what was said and what the conversation is about, but I don't know, who knows, maybe it'll start coming up with like, you know, subject number two has these legal defenses, like, available to him or whatever. I mean, you know, who knows? You know, it's going to put lawyers out of business one day, which whatever. But yeah. So from the like for the summaries. I find that it can be very valuable to, like, point me in the right direction. And so I'm not sitting there just, like, trying to fast forward through through stuff. Because when you do that, you, you also miss stuff. And, you know, I have a duty to my clients, I review everything. There's not one second that I do not review. But having these tools for that kind of stuff, especially when it's very lengthy is a value add and I think will be a bigger and better value add as the technology gets better.
Nick Delgado: Were there any other features or elements specifically to Rev that you felt where they fell short of your expectations?
Ben Evenstad: No, my only thing would be, you know, when I. And again, I'm probably not the, like, ideal interview person because I've only used the service a couple few times. But my only, like, little negative would be when it did do the AI transcript super fast. Super. I won't say affordable. I think it might have been free because I only had, like a kind of a shorter clip. But it just was not as accurate. And again, with accuracy kind of being the number one thing. That'd be my only thing.
Nick Delgado: In addition to yourself, is your paralegal using Rev or any other contractors that you're engaging using Rev through your accounts?
Ben Evenstad: I don't know, with her specifically. So I'm a member of CAALA, do you know what CAALA is? The plaintiff? CAALA is Consumer attorneys Association of Los Angeles. It's the plaintiff's bar. It's a voluntary, but it's mostly solos and smaller firms that represent plaintiffs and consumers as opposed to bigger firms like the represent companies. And we have a listserv which is kind of old school. But I think there's 2000 attorneys on it or somewhere 1800 somewhere in there. Obviously some more active than others. And there's like different listservs that you can be on and some are just about work products. Like, what about this change in the law or what about this new ruling or what's going on with that judge or, you know, whatever. But then there's another listserv. That's CAALA, I think they call it CAALA Life. And it's just like, hey, I need a vendor to, like, do this or that, or, like, I need a temporary office. Whatever. And transcription is something that has come up before on and I know that people have recommended Rev and also recommended other ones. I've never participated or posted in those discussions themselves because I, you know, I already have a service that I'm happy with. If somebody were to ask me, I would recommend Rev. But yeah, I think just from like looking at those threads a couple times, they've popped up. There are other solo attorneys that are certainly using transcription services.
Nick Delgado: Do you find that peer to peer insight and perspective is valuable? Would you put increased emphasis on those recommendations versus like a Google search or other information sources?
Ben Evenstad: Oh, yeah. And yeah, absolutely. And there's been other people that have been practicing. You know, I'm in my 10th year of practice. There are people on CAALA that have been practicing 50 years that, you know, are on there and giving advice and it's, you know, when you work at a firm with 20, 30 attorneys or big law with hundreds of attorneys, you can go down the hallway and knock on someone's door and like, hey, what about this? What about that? Have you ever dealt with this issue? Solos. We don't have that. So CAALA is like our our main, like, way to kind of stay in touch and interact with colleagues that are kind of on the same side. And yeah, I absolutely, if somebody recommend I mean, I was throwing a party a few months ago and I went on there and I'm like, hey, does anyone have a good taco vendor? And yeah, it's just it's people that do the same thing I do day in, day out. I know some of them in person, some I just know I've seen them on the thread. But yeah, I find that extremely valuable. And I would for a legal vendor like transcription service, I would absolutely put more weight on what a some like a CAALA member thinks than just a Google search.
Nick Delgado: What do you do with the transcripts after you receive them?
Ben Evenstad: So in the first one I talked about where it was a body worn, it was a assault with a deadly weapon. It was just in a super small nutshell. It was like a she said she said roommate situation where the allegation was that my client, they had gotten into some kind of dispute in the kitchen, and my client had kind of touched her with a knife and there was a scratch. But there also was kind of like a mutual combat like self-defense element to it. So when the police got there, they interviewed everybody, and there was, like, other witnesses and stuff. So when I got the transcript and this is like I'm saying, the first time I used it and I was so impressed that it I thought it would say person one person two person, you know, whatever. It said like. And I think even one of the officers had had their name had their like Sanchez. Officer Sanchez or whatever. So I had to go through, like, the parts I was going to use that had like, crucial statements. I went through that. You know, you know, slowly myself and compared it just to make sure if I was going to present it in court that it was, is, you know, complete as possible. But for the rest of it, where the areas where I, you know, let's say a witness who wasn't in the room when it happened. So I kind of knew I wouldn't really need to know that much about that or use that. You know, then I just kind of reviewed the transcript. Nothing popped out. So. Yeah. Sorry. I don't know if that answers.
Nick Delgado: Do you use any tools that are integrated with Rev today?
Ben Evenstad: No. But software packages? No. Give me like an like what would.
Nick Delgado: In some cases the transcript could be integrated into a workflow, like into another software for additional processing or part of a broader workflow in general.
Ben Evenstad: So like a Clio type, one of those like, yeah, I understand what you're saying. No, I don't, I am pretty old school and I, you know, I have my Adobe Acrobat, which is like the most powerful piece of software I have. And. No, so I kind of I keep it basic. I've looked into those services, but it's like another monthly fee like another vendor. It's like that's that's one thing I will say. I, you know, I don't know what like revenue models Rev is considering or has or whatever, but I try to limit my subscriptions because I find even if you can cancel anytime. You know, it's like six months goes by and like, how much was I paying a month? And I think I never like. So I try to stay away from anything with a subscription unless I unless like Acrobat like which I could not do without. So no, I've kind of avoided those. Like all in one we do the billing. We also do discovery responses like I don't not for me, not not yet. Maybe. Maybe one day.
Nick Delgado: Are there specific features or functionalities you would like to see added in the future or improved?
Ben Evenstad: Well, like that example I gave when it identified the different speakers where it's not, you know, clear who's speaking. It's not let's say a you know, I'm just imagining this, but if there was like a, you know, let's say you wanted, you had a recording of a phone call where it was, you know, Jen and David and then it'd be pretty easy to say Jen said this, David said that, blah blah, blah. But again, the situations I'm talking about where it's like multiple parties, some things are kind of muffled or some person over here says something, but the video is not on them, so you don't know, but you could put it together like a minute later. So the more that it it could identify each person that is talking and if it could and I know you can, you know, control f and change person one to officer whoever like throughout the whole thing. But if it could identify each speaker that would be huge. And do it again accurately.
Nick Delgado: What are your thoughts on using AI in the legal industry in your field of work?
Ben Evenstad: Yeah. So let me give you an example. Because I, you know, I feel like people, attorneys or lay people or whatever, that, like, they don't understand what is happening with and like how fast things are about to change and are changing have already changed. I'll give you one example. I have a client who's had his home was the subject of a search warrant. A criminal search warrant. They executed the search warrant. They took a ton of stuff, and after they execute a search warrant, they give you a property receipt. This is everything we took from your house and it's been a year. They haven't filed charges. He wants his stuff back. I need to file a motion for return of property. I've never done that before. I looked in practice guides. I could not figure it out. I tried to file it in a civil with a civil clerk's office. They rejected it, and they said we cannot initiate a case based on emotion. Unless there's an asset forfeiture proceeding by the government, we cannot initiate a case. There was no asset forfeiture. There's no nothing. There's no case. So I was at my wit's end with this thing, and I talked to colleagues. I posted on CAALA about it. Nobody knew I could not figure it out. I went to ChatGPT and I described the very specific with more specifics that I'm telling you, and it said, you need to go to the criminal clerk, and the criminal clerk can initiate do case initiation under a miscellaneous setting. And I called the criminal clerk's office in that county and said, hey, this is what I'm trying to do. And the guy said, yeah, that's exactly how to do it. And I asked ChatGPT, where, where did you get that from? Like where the local rule of court or where is that? And it couldn't tell me where it got it from, but it had the 100% correct thing to do. That took me two weeks to try to figure it out. And this isn't the question you asked, but I'll just say this. The state bar, who have a lot of problems with, it is a guild and they will protect us and they will work with lawmakers, in my opinion, and make sure that human attorneys still need to, you know, appear in court. Do you know present evidence? Can only a human attorney can do this? They will limit somewhat. I can do because they want to. The guild wants to protect its members. So I'm not worried about I joke about I'm going to be out of work. I'm not really worried about that, but the, you know, just with, let's say, discovery. Discovery can so much time and it is so repetitive and, you know, I know folks that I don't do personal injury, but I know folks that do personal injury and they have to go through medical records and the AI, even the stuff they're using now, it's like, wow, that would have taken me two full days. That would have taken me, you know, 10.5 hours, whatever it is. And it just got done in ten minutes. I don't know how younger attorneys are going to deal with that. I don't know what our industry is going to look like in a few years. Again, I'm not worried that, you know, I'll be out of work, but the tools are just are so insane and they're only going to get more accurate and more cost efficient and more and easier. So it's it's kind of it's kind of exciting, to be honest.
Nick Delgado: If you were the CEO of Rev, what would you change to better serve firms like yours?
Ben Evenstad: I, you know, one thing would be. You know, get in front of folks like me or, you know, get the product in front of folks like me. So we can try it again. When I asked my wife about it, I had never heard of it. And, yeah, I could have found it maybe on a Google search, but I might have also found five other services and not known which one to use. So like once I used it the first time and it was like like I saw, you know, I didn't, like, arrange a demonstration and like, whatever, I just, like, found it, used it myself. And I was, like, surprised at how good it worked. So I would say if I was a CEO, I would get with my marketing people and say, just get in front of as as many attorneys or firms that might not know about the service and are still doing things the old school way. And I that would be like the starting place. And, you know, let's say I had a case that, you know, some hypothetical like some crazy, you know, multi-million dollar civil case or some crazy murder case or something. And there was a lot of transcription to be done. Then, you know, a service like Rev would be invaluable in a case like that. And. But I would need to know about the service first.

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: When did you first come across Rev?
**Angela Law:** I believe we've had it a month. So, I could be wrong, but I think only a month or so.

Drew Giovannoli: Did you use a different tool before you used Rev for the same reason?
**Angela Law:** I did. I just used my Microsoft Office online to transcribe, or my Dropbox. It has an audio transcription.

Drew Giovannoli: What caused you to look for a tool like Rev?
**Angela Law:** So, another attorney's office was using it and provided us with the transcript, and they said it was a lot more accurate, and that also if we needed a word-for-word transcription, that was a service that goes offered also. So just... I did a test on it and it did work better, and so we ended up purchasing it.

Drew Giovannoli: What kind of work was it used for?
**Angela Law:** Most of the time I'm taking either court audio or I'm getting a, like, a police body camera video. I'm changing it to an audio file and then I'm transcribing it.

Drew Giovannoli: How many people, attorneys and support are at your organization?
**Angela Law:** Two attorneys.

Drew Giovannoli: Did you have certain criteria that were important to you? Accuracy was one you mentioned, but anything else?
**Angela Law:** It needed to be at least what we already had. So, the ability to play back the audio and alter the content if it needed to be altered. Able to add the speaker names and having the timestamps. So, those are the main things. 'Cause I was spending hours and hours trying to correct incorrect audio transcription from Word, and I... It might take me, to do an hour hearing, it probably would take me six hours, 'cause I'd have to listen to the whole thing and then I'd have to go back little by little and change things constantly.

Drew Giovannoli: Are there anything specific about legal that's important for you in the transcript that you either wish Rev had or that you think about when you get that transcript that maybe Rev could learn about?
**Angela Law:** I don't know. I mean, I guess, I guess I wish that we didn't have to, like, have to pay so much more for a transcriptionist to go through it and then certify it. Because right now, we're not even doing the certified transcripts. Yeah, all the little, all the little add-ons and stuff add up.

Drew Giovannoli: What other tools do you use? Do you use Westlaw or a case management tool like Clio? Anything like that?
**Angela Law:** We use Westlaw. We have their AI research, and then we use Practice Panther for our software management.

Drew Giovannoli: Do you use Dropbox or a box for storage?
**Angela Law:** Yeah, we do use Dropbox, and that's integrated into Practice Panther, too.

Drew Giovannoli: Could you think of any integration or workflow that would make life easier for you when it comes to Rev, like something coming into Rev or something going out of Rev that was automatic, that would be helpful?
**Angela Law:** Yeah, so where, like, Dropbox is integrated into Panther, if Rev was integrated into Dropbox, then we'd be able to, as we upload video or audio, if it would automatically provide a transcript so we have that, that would be awesome.

Drew Giovannoli: Have you encountered any challenges or frustrations while using Rev?
**Angela Law:** A couple of times, I messed up and changed the speaker name, and I didn't mean to switch, like, I guess, everything after that to the same name, and then I couldn't change it back. I could not figure out how to, like... You know how in, like, Microsoft, you have a, kinda like a reverse button that undoes your last move? I couldn't figure out how to get rid of what I did, so I had to listen to the whole audio and go back and change the names.

Drew Giovannoli: If you thought about what could make your life easier, are there any features or functionalities that you'd like to see added to Rev?
**Angela Law:** You know, it'd be kinda cool if you could take an audio... Let's say I'm doing a body camera footage of officers. If it would give me questions to ask, not, you know, 'cause I know I get the summaries, but what if I got deposition questions or trial questions that it could prepare based on that audio?

Drew Giovannoli: Something that came up in the past with another lawyer I spoke to was, for something like a DUI, as an example, having the AI have a template that just looks for consent, right? Of the consent asked by the cop, the police person and the acceptance by your client or maybe a comparison of, you upload the police report and then have it compared against the body cam footage to look for things that were omitted or accurate or inaccurate. Would any of those use cases be useful for you?
**Angela Law:** Oh, that would be, that'd be nice. Both of them. I mean, that's kind of what we have to do with the transcripts anyway. That's what we use them for. So if the AI would automatically do that, that would save a lot of time.

Drew Giovannoli: Me prompting those ideas, is there anything else that comes to mind that would be in that category?
**Angela Law:** Maybe doing a timeline summary. I don't know if it already does that with the summary it gives, but if it... Like, if we're talking about, we're doing a preliminary hearing or something and we're interviewing several witnesses, if they could create a timeline of the testimony and what they say occurred, then maybe we can kinda compare and see what's accurate.

Drew Giovannoli: Does your team, your company, they attend any educational events or conferences that Rev could potentially learn to partake in because it's a good spot and sponsor, or where does your company involve itself in the community?
**Angela Law:** I don't know that we do. We go to, you know, conferences and things like that, but we don't, our firm doesn't hold the conferences, so we take classes through the state bar. We do do a annual seminar in Hawaii with the Utah Defense Bar. Not the Utah, I'm sorry, the... I'm trying to remember the name of it. I think it's the Oregon... I don't know. The Oregon State Bar puts on a conference for the western states. I'm trying to remember what it is, but we do an annual November seminar. It's a day long in Hawaii. And there's a lot of presenters there. It's a full day. Just stuff that's by our state bar. You know, just to get our hours in and things. I know Greg's done some out of state seminars. But yeah, that's about it. Most of it's just local stuff.

Drew Giovannoli: Now that you've started to use Rev, in your words, who do you think Rev, what types of firms do you think Rev would be a good fit for?
**Angela Law:** Any kind of litigation firm. I don't think it would help transactional attorneys very much, but anybody that's doing civil or criminal litigation, I think it would be helpful.

Drew Giovannoli: And why is that the case?
**Angela Law:** Just time savers. Like, if you were doing civil litigation and you had depositions, you wouldn't have to automatically wait for the court reporter. If you had the audio, you could just go ahead and get a rough transcript and start drafting discovery or other things that you need or preparing for trial. And with us, it just helps us prep for hearings a lot of the time, so I'll use Rev to, like I said, do the body camera footage and things like that, and then Greg, the other attorney in the office, will use that to prepare his questions for the officers at the preliminary hearing or trial.

Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of Rev, what would you change or prioritize to better serve a company like yours?
**Angela Law:** Well, we're a small firm. We don't even have support staff, so I would say maybe big firm versus small firm pricing, just to make it to where we're not priced out. Like, right now, Westlaw is about to price us out. They just raised all of our stuff to almost $950 a month, and so, and that's per, per login, so each attorney. So, and we're thinking about going another route, just because they're pricing us out. You know, big firms can, you know, send those, and even civil firms can send those costs over to their clients and we can't do that with our practice. So we just have to eat it.

Drew Giovannoli: What about your practice makes it so you're not able to move it on to the client?
**Angela Law:** We charge flat fees, and we charge our fees based on the charge level and where the court's located. You know, 'cause we factor travel into it. But we don't... The only other things we charge our clients is a trial fee obviously, and then if there are trial expenses such as an investigator or expert witness, the client will pay for that. But as far as all the pretrial stuff, we have to eat those costs, so we have to pay for audio transcriptions. We have to pay for the audio files from the courts. We have to pay for medical records, things like that. So, we don't have the ability, like Westlaw was telling me, ""Well, you can just, you know, bill your clients. You do research. You put it under their name, and it goes to a little subfolder so you can see how much you've spent based on that client and apportion it to them."" I'm like, ""Nope, it doesn't work that way."" Like, we're not a civil firm.

Drew Giovannoli: How would Rev determine what firms are structured more like yours versus more clients that can pass the bill on?
**Angela Law:** I would probably say anything that's not criminal defense or, yeah, because everybody else, even if, like personal injury law firms, they can still bill their clients for it if they win a case. They could factor it into their contingency fee as an attorney cost, where we don't do that. So, criminal defense firms most likely are just a flat fee structure, so they're gonna have to eat any of those external costs. If you've got a family law firm, a PI firm, a contract firm that does transactional work, what else? Just basic litigation, depending on the agreement they have with their client, they're able to factor those costs in. And really, also the size of the firm plays a big role, 'cause those bigger firms can afford a lot more, and they typically do pass on costs more to clients than the smaller firms. Because they've already, they've already got a big overhead at the bigger firms.

Drew Giovannoli: Do you have any feedback on pricing that would be more useful to you or packaging that would be more useful?
**Angela Law:** Yeah. If there was a way to package it to make it even more affordable for a smaller firm. Like I said, just the smaller firms don't have the ability to bring in as much money as the larger firms. We don't have the manpower. And so, it, we have to absorb those costs a lot more than a larger firm. So, even if a larger firm was able to, to pa- you know, to eat that cost instead of billing their clients, they still have... Let's say you have a 20 attorney law firm with support staff and stuff, they're able to bring in a lot more money than a two-man office. And so, it's just, you know, a drop in the bucket for them to pay, you know, $30 for a login or whatever it is. Or to pay for the transcriptions themselves. The certified ones.

Drew Giovannoli: When you get the transcript back from Rev, are you downloading it as a Word, Doc or PDF and then uploading it to Strava? How are you using it exactly, those transcripts?
**Angela Law:** I'm uploading both the summary and the transcript in Word to my Dropbox, and then I print it out and I stick it in the hard file.

Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything about Rev or transcriptions that I haven't asked about that you think Rev would benefit from hearing?
**Angela Law:** Hmm. Not that I know of. If we could do, like you said, you were talking about an integration, if we could do that with Dropbox or other software, that'd be great.

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: Can you introduce your role at the firm?
Trish Herrera: Yeah. So I've been with Mr. Lewis for, sheesh, nearly 20 years now. I'm technically, I guess, a legal assistant, but I kind of do everything here. I'm the only one in the office besides him, so I do it all.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there other people at the company, or is it the two of you now?
Trish Herrera: It's just the two of us. We had another attorney with us up until January of this year, and then she kind of left the state, so she's not here anymore.
Drew Giovannoli: What prompted you to try a service like Rev's? And were you using anything before it?
Trish Herrera: We were pretty much doing our own transcription before, or we'd have maybe, I guess, like contract workers that we had used before to do it. And then one of our other. I worked with another attorney for a few years along with Mr. Lewis, and she uses Rev. And when we had a couple needs come up, we thought about having me transcribe it, and then it was like, well, let's try it out, Rev. Let's see how it works out. So we did it. We were pretty happy with it, so that's what started it. So it was a referral basically, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you use the AI or human transcription?
Trish Herrera: We actually use both. We tested out the human one first because we just wanted to see what it was like and how accurate it was, and did an amazing job. The second time, we just kind of wanted to mess around with the AI and see how it worked out, and it was pretty good. It had some not so accurate things, like maybe about who was talking, which you can understand, but it was overall pretty good. I was impressed.
Drew Giovannoli: For what types of work do you use transcription today?
Trish Herrera: So typically we use. Mostly we do, like, pre trial interviews, sometimes with officers, sometimes with just other witnesses, people like that. That's typically what we use it for. In this instance, we used it for a public hearing that was held in one of our neighboring counties. And I think both of the times we used it, we used it for that.
Drew Giovannoli: When you were evaluating using Rev as an option, what criteria was important to you?
Trish Herrera: For us at that moment, obviously price, that's always the one, everybody. But turnaround time was actually a big one for us. And the attorney that referred us basically was pretty happy with the turnaround time. She told us, we get it back at least within 24 hours or so. And so that was kind of a big thing for us was the turnaround time.
Drew Giovannoli: Were there any of those criteria that are legal-specific, anything you had in your mind as you evaluated Rev?
Trish Herrera: Right. I looked at the data security and for what we specifically used it for, it wasn't a big deal because like I said, it was a public hearing. But that could come into play when, like I said, we do witness interviews and things like that. Especially if you have like victims in cases, you can't have a lot of their stuff get out there. So that would be, I think that would be on a case to case basis. Data security.
Drew Giovannoli: Have you looked at Rev security and decided whether it's secure?
Trish Herrera: Yeah, yeah, it looks pretty good. I was actually impressed with the thoroughness, but it was pretty good. I was impressed, because sometimes you send it out to freelancers that in the area or something and occasionally you'll get a transcriptionist that happens to know the witness or something like that and you're like, oh no, that's not good. Or the cop or something like that. So sometimes using a company like this would be safer than maybe a local person.
Drew Giovannoli: Have you tried any of the AI features?
Trish Herrera: Not aside from just the transcription. No, we just used the transcription for the AI and I think it was, I want to say it was like a one hour hearing and I can't remember exactly how long it was. But that's the only thing we've actually used.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you expect or want to use it for other things in the future?
Trish Herrera: Honestly, I don't know. It sounds like. Because I talked to my. I told him this was going on and I was like, hey, is there anything you actually want me to say to Rev? And he said that he was actually very impressed with the results and he plans to pretty much use this as our go to now. So he was impressed. But as far as AI, he hasn't used it for a whole lot of other things and neither have I. So neither of us is really too AI savvy right now. But he likes to write his own motions and briefs and everything, so he hasn't really used it for a lot.
Drew Giovannoli: What other tools do you use at the company?
Trish Herrera: Well, of course, Outlook, everybody uses Outlook. We use a program called Clio for our calendar management. We kind of use it in line with Outlook too. But Clio is basically our. Where everything goes on our calendars.
Drew Giovannoli: Anything else besides Clio?
Trish Herrera: Dropbox, I guess would be the other thing we use. Dropbox, Clio. Let me see here. I mean, nothing aside from like Office, Microsoft Office, Adobe. That's about it.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you have any challenges or frustrations with that first use of Rev, anything you wish was improved?
Trish Herrera: No, actually I was pretty surprised at how well it worked.
Drew Giovannoli: If you began to use it for more of your cases, how do you think it could help your business?
Trish Herrera: As far as efficiency? It would be nice because like I said, a lot of times we either use somebody out of house or sometimes I'll transcribe and obviously that takes a lot of time and takes away from my other work. So for that it would be really helpful considering I'm the only one here. So that's been really nice. And he was. And my boss felt like it was worth the cost of paying for the transcription versus either paying me to do it or when we send them out, I want to say that man, they're going right. Last I knew, I think they were charging anywhere from 250 to $3. I forget how they work that now. Is it from per hour? I know that's not right. I can't remember anyway. It got kind of expensive. And we weren't having great results with people. Accuracy was pretty good, but I mean, we were looking at a two to three week turnaround time sometimes.
Drew Giovannoli: Rev is pretty fast.
Trish Herrera: Yeah. Yeah, it's nice.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything in terms of templating or formatting that's important to you? When you get these back, are you submitting these anywhere or is this just for internal use?
Trish Herrera: Sometimes they get submitted to opposing counsel. We do review them for our own safety, of course, our own accuracy. They sometimes will get submitted as exhibits to motions, partial, pages here and there. Format isn't too much of an issue because it mo. The both. The ones we got back seem to follow kind of our format, which was pretty decent. As long as it separates the speakers and things like that. It was. We can pretty much use those as they come. Yeah, but, yeah, we typically. That's about, we'll submit them to opposing counsel. Sometimes they're attached to motions, sometimes they're using exhibits in court. And then sometimes, like, my boss will just want that along with the recording so that he can kind of timestamp stuff sometimes so he knows where to go in the recording.
Drew Giovannoli: What other work do you have to do that's related to this casework that Rev could potentially do to make your life easier?
Trish Herrera: I'm trying to think of, like, data, specific stuff that we do. I mean, you scan in exhibits, labeling exhibits, maybe just organizing what we call discovery. I don't know how familiar you are with legal, but the documents that go between the parties, basically, that's pretty much my job. Maybe something like labeling or exhibits, something like that. I don't know. That's about all I can think that we could potentially send out. But other than that, I can't really. I mean, maybe like. Like I was saying with the time stamping of stuff, maybe like. I don't know. It's hard to say. Yeah. That's about all I can think of. Maybe just like more specifics on, like if we send a video in maybe like, because I think you guys do. Or they do timestamp, right?
Drew Giovannoli: Yes, absolutely.
Trish Herrera: I think we just didn't pay for that that one time. But I'm pretty sure they timestamped and that may be something we take advantage of.
Drew Giovannoli: Have you interacted with the Rev team at all outside logging into service?
Trish Herrera: No, in fact, I was actually going to look at that just to make sure. I think we got one email just asking. I'm trying to look. Hold on. Just if we were happy with the accuracy. I think that was on the first one that we did. And that was the human transcriptionist. So I understand why they reach out. Like does that. Is that good? So I just responded and said everything looked good. So that was it though.
Drew Giovannoli: When you bought it the first time, did you just buy like per minute human?
Trish Herrera: Yeah, yeah. Both times we did it in fact the same thing with the AI one we just did it that for that one use. I think if we used it more, we may do like. Because I know there were plans, we'd probably do something like that. But for now I think it just works as a paper request because we can also attach that to our billing sometimes.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you pass these costs on to the customer?
Trish Herrera: Those specific ones? We did not. But I know in the future if it was case specific, it would be. They kind of go into the cost totals and things like that. So we'd probably have to do it separately in that case also. Unless there was some kind of breakdown that we could prove what we spent on that one transcription.
Drew Giovannoli: Would it be helpful in these packages for law if there was a per case fee or you could start and stop a timer or some sort of billing codes per client?
Trish Herrera: Yeah. Even if we, I mean, not necessarily a stop. Well, I guess you could do a stop and start, but when it comes to things like sending out transcription. Usually you can just submit that one invoice like that. So if we could get the invoices separately or at least some kind of ledger that would separate that one case out from the rest, that would be helpful. And maybe they do that. We just didn't really look into it a whole lot.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that I haven't brought up about the product or the process of using Rev that could help them improve?
Trish Herrera: No, honestly, I don't think so. I mean, like I said, we were pleasantly surprised. We didn't really go into it with a whole lot of high expectations. It's sad to say that, but sometimes when you send things out, you're like, ah, it's not going to come back right. And we were both pleasantly surprised at how it turned out.

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: How did you start using Rev? Was it in discovery that you were processing files or what was the exact use case?
Bart Kaspero: The exact use case was a type of, I don't know how involved you are in the legal landscape, but with my bread and butter, something came out of completely left field. Somebody got what's called a civil citation from a code enforcement officer. The guy who got the civil citation, he was a big landlord. This is not my forte. And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting. So what ended up was through discovery, I got this thumb drive of an hour long meeting, four people I've never met and one with my client. And I'm like, I don't want to watch this thing. It's going to take forever. So I uploaded that thing to Rev, which came as a referral, by the way, from another attorney who is local to me. So I think it was literally, I reached out. Do you use any kind of transcription service? Do you have like a quick and dirty one? Just a quick and dirty, like I don't need some official, I don't need names. I just put the sounds into text and let me just read the damn thing and that turned out to be a 20 something or 30 something page transcription. And I do mean dirty. And that's what I wanted. I didn't want Speaker 1 to be identified. Speaker 2. I just wanted to what the hell are they talking about? And it did the trick. So that was my very first use case. I was not going to use that transcript in any hearing. I simply wanted to read it to see what happened during that one hour hearing. And then I gave it to my client saying, read this. And it was an eye opener to him because if I would have said, go watch that zoom, it would have taken him two weeks to do it. But instead I uploaded those pages and he's like, oh, wow. Yeah, now I know why they ruled against me. He was able to see it with his own eyes. So that was an incredibly useful use case. And that was on the free limited plan, right? Where I only have a certain number of megabytes or gigabytes I could upload or number of times, but it was just me dipping my toe in, so it really was good to do that.
Drew Giovannoli: I saw in your experience under criminal defense law, there's DUI, assault, felony public intoxication. I've heard people use Rev for body cam footage transcription. Would that fall into that discovery category?
Bart Kaspero: It would. And I only hesitate to upload those things because I have not had a serious enough moment to be like, okay, I'm going to upload this right now. I got to make sure that my own attorney client privilege duties are not being, you know, whatever.
Drew Giovannoli: So just because of the security compliance potential concerns?
Bart Kaspero: Yeah. And it's not that I don't trust Rev for that. I haven't had the moment where I'm going to upload a body worn camera video like that where I'm like, okay, can I use this to make sure that this is going to be okay and it's not going to be, because anything could be breached these days. I get it. I have cyber security insurance. I have to be very mindful of stuff like this. So I haven't had a moment where I'm like, all right, let me get this transcribed real quick. Believe it or not, though, I do have a motion coming up where that's coming. So if we would not have had this conversation, I would have been looking through the terms and conditions or through the FAQ.
Drew Giovannoli: What was the shift that made you inclined to try to use Rev more? Was it just awareness that you didn't have to have a subscription?
Bart Kaspero: Believe it or not, before I saw the pricing, pay by the minute. Little tiny purple link right there. Right under the monthly versus yearly savings. My thought process was when I'm finally going to need it officially and start ponying up the dollars I will actually pay for the subscription. The fact that they have a pay for pricing or the pay by the minute pushes that needle entirely over. Like I'm not even going to look for an alternative. I'm not even interested in looking for an alternative. It's either going to be the court, the physical court reporters that I've used in the court which I had to actually hire for that exact use case that I told you about. I actually had to have a physical court reporter when I did the evidentiary hearing. But ironically for Rev and maybe even beneficially for Rev transcript, it took longer than I thought it was going to take. My client himself dragged his feet in paying. So the whole experience was actually quite, what do they call it in high touch, low touch SaaS applications. It was very, it was too much. And that experience was just like, okay, next time I'm just going to go back to the Rev. I'm just going to pay for the official pricing or the subscription. So the pay by the minute was the needle went all the way to the side. And the only reason I discovered that was because we set this meeting up because I clicked on it.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you use Westlaw or any sort of case management system like Clio?
Bart Kaspero: Both.
Drew Giovannoli: What's been your experience using any AI functionality in either of them?
Bart Kaspero: Westlaw Precision. I don't use co counsel because I don't have a use case for it, but I do use precision for research. Think of it as like a very advanced GPT prompt based research, which is great, believe it or not. It's not ironclad. Like nothing is. But it's as close as you can possibly get without burning out and like going through five or six or seven different sources and clicking and clicking and clicking and reading and reading and reading. It's at least a very quick, generative, closed loop corpus, which Westlaw's, Thompson, Reuters, they've got the corpus. They've got the material to reference. So there's a safety net of that in the Clio. I haven't used any AI functionality. They there, I know that they have a workflow in drafting offer. I'm just not ready to pay more. I'm not ready to sign up for it right now. I get it. Everybody's got a AI feature or something like that and they're like, well, you know, for $20 more, $50 more, or now you can use the premium 120 AI feature. It's like, dude, it's gonna get like the subscription services. Eventually you're gonna stop subscribing to the Netflix and the Hulus and all that.
Drew Giovannoli: Rev has AI functionality in their subscription. I've spoken to some lawyers who work with DUI cases and they express interest in having AI look for consent, look for terms around consent as a natural highlight out of every DUI transcript they upload. Is that something you would find value in?
Bart Kaspero: Let me rephrase. There's AI that you prompt questions against. There's also ways to use AI in a more templated manner. Like we know that every transcript we're going to want to look at the difference between what the police write up is and what actually happened in the transcript. And maybe you can break down, always provide kind of a little highlight of the differences found in the transcript versus the police write up or always look for words of consent. I'm just curious if those are things you would ever want to use.
Bart Kaspero: The answer is yes, absolutely. Is that already a feature that is integrated with Rev already or is that something that they might be building out and just kind of testing the end users like myself and other DUI attorneys?
Drew Giovannoli: The exact example is not in there yet, but they have AI functionality to prompt against. This is kind of an emerging thing from my interviews that I'm going to bring back to them.
Bart Kaspero: Oh, I see what you're saying. Okay, then the short answer is absolutely yes.
Drew Giovannoli: Does anything else come to mind that would be useful within your world?
Bart Kaspero: Yeah, absolutely. Any kind of basically police interaction period. Domestic violence cases, I don't get a lot of recordings outside of criminal cases. I do restraining orders on both petitioners and respondent sides, but that's only if somebody's like recorded the conversation or something or something like that. Or left a voicemail. That's not necessary. Those are usually like just a minute long. But in terms of police interaction, a hundred percent. Anything that's recorded can be used and propped up against the report. And it's like what things were brought up, what questions were brought up by the officer or lines of questioning were brought up by the officer where nothing gets reflected in their report. That would be a pretty powerful prompt. Because the prompt covers topics A, B, C, D, E. But the actual physical body worn camera or audio recording transcript, it's going to talk about dozen or two dozen aspects, hey, where are you going? Have you ever been arrested before? Like there'll be all sorts of different kinds of questioning that can be used as potential fodder for cross examining someone.
Drew Giovannoli: Have you tried any other tools that you could compare to Rev?
Bart Kaspero: No, that was it. And it was a trusted person. And I'm like, all right, they use that. I'll use it. It was literally like that. I didn't Google for any AI transcription web application or. No, I didn't look for any of that. It was, I didn't even do a online query. It was just question from a referral. And then they provided. We use Rev.
Drew Giovannoli: Would you recommend Rev to others?
Bart Kaspero: Yes, I think I already have. I think I already have. First to that client, that first use case, he's kind of a do it yourselfer type. It's financing of himself to buy a large multi million dollar commercial marketplace. And when he wanted to use the transcript, I'm like, no, no, no, this is not official, it's not certified or anything like that. He goes, oh, okay. So he just used it.
Drew Giovannoli: Have you had any challenges or frustrations with Rev?
Bart Kaspero: No, because I know what I was paying for. I wanted the quick dirt, quick and dirty, so I didn't really put it to any kind of strict tests where I would be evaluating it by some kind of higher standard. I just wanted bare bones. Show me the words. Show me the words so I could read it faster.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were running Rev, what would you prioritize to better serve a customer like yourself?
Bart Kaspero: They already did it. I was so surprised by the pay by the minute because running a practice or just being a professional at all the number of tools that we have to pony up and be on a yearly subscription for or a monthly subscription is starting to get ridiculous. Like, I can't. I had to do a what do you call it when you record yourself and you're gonna post it online to basically, like a how to. Or, hey, watch out for your rights. I can't tell you how many apps I had to go through on my phone where it automatically puts your words on the spot with good font. And I came across details. And if you use the free version, of course, there's limited features and it's got their little logo up here on the top. But for that one damn thing, like, I'm probably gonna use it three times, four times a year. They're like, well, you could sign up for a subscription. It's like, I don't need a fucking subscription again. I don't need another damn subscription. So to answer your question, is pay by the minute without having to do a monthly or annually. And I get it. ARR. MRR. I get it. A lot of SaaS companies have to measure their growth that way. I think that model is going to be broken very soon. You can't have 30 subscriptions a damn month. All it takes is for one person to take it in the ass financially. You're going to see a lot of cancellations very quickly. So I don't think. I get it. The Valley wants the subscription model. I get it. Any tech company. I get it. They want the subscription model. I get it. It's just you're gonna have to pull it out of me.
Drew Giovannoli: When you think about your professional network, are there certain conferences, educational forums where these types of tools get shared that Rev could participate in?
Bart Kaspero: Oh yeah, I'm not very active in any of these kinds of things. Even for criminal defense, I don't bother going to these things. I just get my continuing education credits. But a no brainer would obviously be like DUI associations. Or you know, what would actually be very beneficial to you guys? Look up the California Public Defenders association. CPDA. I think you will find a very active audience there because these are county employees. Public defenders are county employees, which is what I used to be. And they are always up for cutting some costs on stuff like this. And instead of having them send out videos or audios and get it transcribed from a trans and then getting approval from a supervisor and then making sure that the court okays the funds, this might put that on steroids. If they just have a Rev subscription for an entire county of like hundreds of lawyers. Like literally hundreds of lawyers. You guys can do some info sessions, kind of how to use it. Just the dirty version. The really quick dirty version. Hey, say you got a motion tomorrow, you got a suppression hearing for a DUI where you're all about consent and you want to know whether or not they consented. The search of the car. Upload the damn video. Boom, boom, boom. Go get a coffee break, come back, you have the transcript right there in front of you. And that's the dirty version of where you can scan it. So you, Mr. Mrs. Public Defender, don't have to sit there for two and a half hours and watch that interview in the jail. Those things take forever and somebody's got to watch those things. And it's either me or a paralegal, which I don't have. I think there's 58 counties here in California and those public defender offices are ginormous. I think a single account where they pay as you go is worth many, many multiple 10x's of a single law office.
Drew Giovannoli: Is it directly to the CPDA or to the county themselves?
Bart Kaspero: County themselves. So you may want to reach out. California is a big state and 58 is not a large number. And you could probably target the most populated counties first if you want. Kind of get a feel for their reaction to stuff. CPDA is just a way to kind of like shortcut the whole process. And because they do continuing education statewide multiple times a year. So it'd just be an easy conference to go to. It'd be an easy sponsorship to put money behind one of their quarterly magazines or something like that. That would probably break a couple bottlenecks for you guys. And public defenders are. When they can't afford legal assistance there. It's a state appointed attorney. So by the time they ultimately show up to court, we used to be juggling 20, 30 cases a day? A day. Different cases. And you're in court all day. So by the time you get back to the office to do this or looking through books, anything that cuts down on time significantly is a major game changer. So just imagine, like I used to dread having to prepare for a motion or a hearing where I had to go through all the recording evidence. I just did not have the time. I would take it home like an idiot. Which is why I was there only for two years. Not scalable. This could put them on steroids. I think you'll get some mileage out of them.

Transcript
Q: Do you mind just starting by introducing yourself?
Hillary Chapa: My name is Hillary Chapa. I am a paralegal for a law firm. And part of what we do is why we've needed to use rev.com. And I've tested out other platforms to do the same thing and found that Rev had the most consistent accuracy.

Q: How many people are at your law firm?
Hillary Chapa: Let's see, there is five paralegals. And then we have I think 12 attorneys.

Q: What is the use case? What are you trying to use it for?
Hillary Chapa: So we have some audio hearings that occur. And what we've done is transcribed the audio so that we can have a written format to submit to arbitrators so that they can actually read it versus having to just hear it, depending on whether they, you know, whichever they prefer.

Q: You're recording the actual court hearing?
Hillary Chapa: Not the court hearing. We have different hearings that occur just depending on the type of case that we're handling at the moment. And so it's not necessarily a court hearing. They are hearings that are arbitration or mediation type. Not necessarily mediation but arbitration type hearings.

Q: Are you using the AI or the human transcription?
Hillary Chapa: We're using the AI.

Q: What happens after you receive this transcription? What do you do with it?
Hillary Chapa: I listen to the audio and I review it for accuracy. And then once I've reviewed it for accuracy, I will send it to the attorney. And most of the time we've been submitting it as an exhibit. So we'll have the audio for them to hear, but also the transcription for them to read. And they'll be a part of our exhibits for our defense.

Q: When you send it to the attorney, you're sending it as a PDF or word file. How does that come across?
Hillary Chapa: I do both. So I'll download the word and the PDF just so that we can have whatever the original I created the rev.com. And then what we'll do is once I hear it, I'll send the revised word document so that they have both.

Q: What is the audio originally coming from?
Hillary Chapa: To be honest with you, I am not 100% how the original audio is being recorded. I say that because it's something that's sent to us. So I've seen it where it's just audio, I've seen it where it's video and audio. The ones that I have done more commonly are just audio, and I'm not 100% sure, you know, if it's like a recording device or if it's through a computer or phone or what, I don't have that knowledge.

Q: Are you then uploading it to any other system, maybe a case management tool or something else?
Hillary Chapa: We do. We have our case management software that we use just, you know, for an online paperless file. And they are saved.

Q: Are you using Clio or something else?
Hillary Chapa: No, we're using carrot legal.

Q: What other vendors you used and why you kept looking for someone else?
Hillary Chapa: So I belong to a paralegal group, and the other platforms that have been recommended were like, I think it's like Otter. And so when I utilized Otter and I was doing my, you know, audio and listening for accuracy. I had a lot of discrepancies. And so I just chose not to use it again. And that may have been based off of that one audio recording. I just I knew that Rev.com had been used by other people in our office. And so because they had a better accuracy, they already had an established kind of basis of how it worked and how accurate and consistent it was. I just decided to go with them versus wasting more time trying to figure out, you know, different ones. I just wanted to try out the otter because other paralegals had stated that they used it and they loved it, but it wasn't the same for my case.

Q: Is this paralegal group kind of an unofficial text thread, or is there an official forum or group?
Hillary Chapa: It's unofficial.

Q: Beyond the accuracy, what other things have you found useful about Rev?
Hillary Chapa: It's very user friendly. You're not having to figure out a whole new technology and how it's utilized. It's just simple, plain, consistent, you know, like, concise as far as what you need to do. It's fairly quick. And then you have your summaries that you can use when it populates. And then obviously the full audio transcription. So I liked that. I tend to be a little tech savvy, or at least I think I am. But it's something that anybody could go to the website and figure out how to utilize it.

Q: Has there anything that's been frustrating or challenging for you?
Hillary Chapa: No, not that I'm aware of.

Q: What other software tools do you use?
Hillary Chapa: We have Westlaw. But that's for, you know, the legal research and so forth, but not anything else that I can think of off the top of my head.

Q: Do you use box or Dropbox or any file storage system?
Hillary Chapa: We use Sharefile, but it's only when we're needing to receive or send out large files that exceed the capacity of an email.

Q: Are there any integrations you could think of where you wish the files from rev either float into rev or out of rev in a way that would save you some time?
Hillary Chapa: Not that I'm 100% sure of. I mean, I love process and procedures and simplicity and working smarter, not harder kind of thing. I just don't know that we utilize it enough at this point where we're at to say, hey, an integration with our legal software would make a huge, profound, you know, time saving situation. I'm sure it would in the sense of if there's an audio, I can just click a button that says, you know. Transcribe, you know, and that it works in the background. And it tells me that when it's ready and then I can view it for accuracy. But that's just, you know, instead of clicking a button to download the audio and then dragging and dropping to rev.com. I don't see it as a huge thing that would make or break a difference, if that makes sense.

Q: We would use it more if Rev could do this or was different in this way. Does anything come to mind?
Hillary Chapa: No. Just because it's a limited situation that we're using these for, and it varies. What we what we've been using it for is kind of limited to one client at this moment, and it just depends on how many situations. Now there is a possibility that we could utilize it across the board. I'm not 100% sure how much that is needed at this point.

Q: For your other cases, do you have audio files that you're transcribing in another way? And if not transcribing, how do you manage some of those other audio files?
Hillary Chapa: We don't we do have other audio files, but we do not transcribe them at all. We just share those as needed. So there isn't any other software that's being used. We're not even going to the extreme or the length to have them to transcribe through any other software.

Q: Is there a perhaps a legal reason why it's beneficial to not have it in writing, or is it just the way things have been done?
Hillary Chapa: In the capacity that I have. So there's a couple of different types of cases that we handle. So we have what's called limited binding arbitration that we handle, but we also handle lawsuits that are in the district courts of Texas. And so with our limited with our limited binding arbitration hearings, we have to submit our evidence to an arbitrator to review it. And so one thing that we do just to give as much as we can to the arbitrator without having to take that extra time of, let me try to play this, is there that they can just read it if they want to or read it and listen to it at the same time, whatever. So that's the main purpose and our limited binding arbitration hearings. They aren't. We don't have an abundance of them in the sense that it's an equal proportion to our district court cases. And that's why with our district court cases, all of our cases have audio, but that's part of evidence that we send to opposing counsel. And so we just don't take the time and resources to transcribe it for them.

Q: If you could give rev advice on who either the types of cases or even the types of legal firms that you think would have a heavy need for it or more obvious use case. Does anything come to mind?
Hillary Chapa: I would say maybe cases that handle a lot of mediations handle more arbitration. Kind of handle more of the more more of the meetings between opposing counsel and, and, you know, the the plaintiff and defendant when situations are like that where there is a mediator present. I think the mediator part is a little bit more difficult just because you don't want to record either side based off of just the way mediations occur. I would say arbitration, maybe I don't have any other knowledge of where it would be helpful. I've done criminal law, and I don't I don't see that there would be a need at this point. Unless you're, like, interviewing a witness and it's all recorded. And you want you want to have a document for it? You know, like, if you had a private investigator interviewing a witness, something like that. Maybe family law. When maybe wills and probate. But I'm not just. I'm not too sure that that would. I haven't worked in those fields specifically to know what the confidentiality would need to be for these types of situations.

Q: Have you played around with the AI functionality at all?
Hillary Chapa: No I haven't, I've just used it to transcribe the audio.

Q: Is there any work that you have to do after you get the transcript to search through that text to create, to search for certain terms, to pull a summary that you have to do?
Hillary Chapa: No there isn't I. I just listened to it for accuracy and make any small changes. And really, that's going to be more so because the enunciation of the speaker wasn't clear. And so, for instance, one that I did recently, it was like I wrote peace, but the person was talking about bees. And so that's the only. That, you know, it's small things like that. But obviously, you know, that's more of an enunciation sort of thing that, I don't know, I would necessarily pick up on, especially if it's an audio recording and it's, you know, a little distant from the person talking.

Q: If you were the CEO of Rev, what would you change or do to better serve a company like yourself?
Hillary Chapa: I think I would try to integrate with different platforms especially that utilize more of the audio recordings that need to be transcribed. I think I know you mentioned Cleo earlier. I know that there's a lot of people that that are on Cleo. A lot of people are on my case, those are two really popular ones. I know file, one file vine is something. And I would just try to see how we could integrate. Obviously things need to be done, you know, at a price, cost. But I think trying to minimize that fee because, yes, it's useful, but at what point, you know, if we're going to be charging per transcription, are we going to be charging on a monthly? And how much is that and how useful is it going to be, you know, and is the expense worth it? And so I think all of those things need to be taken into account for before it just becomes an automatic addition to it. But I would definitely like research the market and different types of firms that could potentially use it. And if they utilize something else. Now, you know what? I don't know what other ways would make it more efficient or, you know, quicker kind of thing. It's just because of my limited capacity.",Interview with Hillary Chapa.txt (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/43/43/1752724800000/V_G6uDTFbTQQZQ13oMiG5A/G8DPZ2U4xYIOqOKN5SOj7A1JG-dS3nAUhicXw7WI9KdyZJXWFknhOmKnH-MEiSIGvX2fkCoHyuIIiaqMm4GICq6oOniYT71KgzI7kK1tWoMLOkB4Ws9CmjqX6JYAADUL9JPI1UuoI6zE_n3lyeoBsP5ua4ls0clZzvWJKsGB5BFAYwI3j2dO8mvcocDNUoXJ/dbi-JE192ukHcM3mPfeF5jXQSKDDLDMzGMUnY3LT6wk)

Transcript
What is your role at NACE Law Group?
Betty Behrens: I'm a paralegal.

How big is NACE Law Group?
Betty Behrens: Two attorneys, hopefully hiring more. So.

Are you the only paralegal?
Betty Behrens: No. There are two other paralegals.

How long have you been using Rev?
Betty Behrens: I was introduced to Rev probably maybe three years ago. When it was. It was something before it was Rev, right?

You're using the AI version for transcription?
Betty Behrens: AI. The AI version for transcription.

So they had a product called Temi?
Betty Behrens: That's it. Yeah. So I started using it when it was Temi. Right.

For what work do you use it right now?
Betty Behrens: Right now we use it for transcription of taped conversations with either our experts. I've used it calls with witnesses, just rather than take notes, record it, and then have Rev transcribe it for our files. We use it for, we had a client who had taken some voice notes during a meeting with a doctor at a hospital. And we transcribed those. So that's primarily what I'm using Rev for.

Are those transcriptions ever shared externally for any reason?
Betty Behrens: I've never shared them with anybody else. No. Just internal use.

Including court submissions?
Betty Behrens: Never. I've never done that. No.

When you get the transcription back, what do you do with it?
Betty Behrens: Yeah. We would save it to we have case management software that we use, we use Neos as our case management system. And we'll add it to the memos file in there. It's all digital. We move it around, we might attach it to an email to somebody and say, hey, here are the notes from conversation with Doctor Jones. He reviewed our case and that sort of thing. I, I don't I'm sure I would I haven't had the chance to do it yet, but it would certainly be helpful when drafting expert reports that are case filings to go back to those notes, maybe copy and paste some of the wording in my report to help with the outline of a report. Yeah.

Can you help me understand that use case and if there's anything Rev could do to make that easier?
Betty Behrens: Sure. So I primarily work with medical malpractice and personal injury cases. And specifically in medical malpractice cases, we have to find an expert in the same field of medicine as the doctor that we're suing. To say that there was negligence and violations of standards of care. That's the number one thing we have to do to prove our case. So generally and these are medical heavy stuff. I know some stuff about medicine, not a lot. So we tend to record conversations with these physicians that review the cases for us, review the records and say, oh, Doctor Jones missed this on the x ray and this is what happened and what he should have done, etc., etc.. And then later in the case we have to file with the court a report saying this is what our expert is going to say at trial. And they have to be pretty thorough. And so what I would expect that I would do, if I had a transcription from one of those calls with our expert, I would go back to that in order to draft that report and maybe copy and paste some stuff from that transcription into the report, that sort of thing.

Is there anything Rev could do to make that easier for you?
Betty Behrens: I don't know. I don't think so. I mean, it's pretty straightforward.

What other tools do you use today?
Betty Behrens: A lot of Adobe. Just in terms of, bate stamping, organizing records, bookmarking them in terms of organization, mostly for organization presentation, as well. So we use that we use a trial program at trial to project our exhibits, which are PDFs. Called on cue is something we use, and then case management and really it's just templates and word and converting those to PDF to electronically file them in court. We're trying some more I trying to use that, use AI generation of demand letters and like auto accident cases, which are pretty straightforward. Somebody gets in an accident, they hurt their back. Here are the bills. Your client was at fault. Those are pretty Easy to AI generate. We haven't done a whole lot of that, but we're trying to explore that. There's a group we're using called toxicity that will take the case from the get go, get all the records, feed them in, and I will spit out a demand letter for us. So we're not doing that ourselves. We're sort of farming that out at this point.

Would it be useful if Rev integrated into any of those tools you mentioned?
Betty Behrens: Well, certainly with we're still trying to find the perfect solution for summarizing medical records. You know, you've got somebody who, I don't know, like a chest x ray that isn't read, right. And then later down the line, they're found to have lung cancer or something. I need to find some system that can take these literally hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages of records and pull out and prepare a chronology of care. I need somebody who can take all those bills and make a nice spreadsheet of dates of service and what that cost and subtotals and totals. I haven't found that yet. Sure. In a in a manageable format.

Can you rank these criteria as you evaluate tools like Rev: cost, speed, accuracy, data security?
Betty Behrens: Accuracy would have to be the most important. Cost would have to be in their data security. And. Yeah.

Have you evaluated any tools like Soup.io or EvenUp?
Betty Behrens: We used EvenUp, and we are no longer using EvenUp. We did not. I personally didn't use them, but the attorneys and the firm have, they were not happy with the work product. And the time I think it took EvenUp to do that. And then they, like, totally flaked out on us at one point. And we had some projects with them, and then they just went off the radar and we had to hunt them down. Yeah, it was not a good parting. Soup.io has been trying to contact us. I think they were a sponsor of, like, on injury board, which is what we're, members of. I think they sponsored some webinar or something. But I haven't tried. I've heard of Scipio, but we haven't worked with them. No.

Have you tested any of the AI features within Rev?
Betty Behrens: No, I haven't yet. I haven't. Yeah.

Is that because of bandwidth or hesitations?
Betty Behrens: Definitely. It's just definitely bandwidth. Yeah. I just I sort of can't keep up with all that's out there in terms of AI. Like I said, we've tried drips and drabs going. I mean, it's the future, right? We have to figure out how we can harness it. But yeah, it's just a little too much too soon. And so, I'm just sort of getting through right now. I don't have anything where I have the luxury of sort of trying something out at this time. So it really is just sort of a, just finding the time to, or make the time to check it all out. But, I mean, we've got to find something because it's just it's it's the future, right? So everyone's going to be doing it.

Have you used any other transcription tools besides Rev?
Betty Behrens: I don't think so.

Is there anything about Rev that would be more legal specific that could be baked into the product?
Betty Behrens: I can't really think of anything specific. If I were to say if it could be more streamlined, then it would be more on the medical side, just in terms of trying to organize all those records and get them in in a way that's easy to go through, which is, I mean, what we use in our legal practice. But, I can't think of anything legal wise. I mean, maybe that would be something for firms that do sort of mass tort stuff that have just reams and reams of documents, organizing that sort of like discovery process. That would certainly be helpful. We don't have that.

Is it just you at the firm who's using Rev, and how does it actually work?
Betty Behrens: So. I'm, I think I'm the only one currently using Rev in my firm. I know that Chris Nace, the managing partner, he tends to record his calls when he's. We use zoom for our phone system. So when he's talking to the experts, I think zoom has a feature to summarize the call. I don't know that they record it, but I think they do an I summary. And we refer back to those notes when we're on the topic on the case, they're not very good because they're missing nuance. Right. That's why a transcription is, much more effective for what we want. And then. Yeah, we don't do much with them except internal use. We're looking at them as the case is progressing when we need to know what our experts opinions are going to be, we're not sharing them with the other side. We're not sharing them even with other witnesses in the case, because it's all discoverable and you don't want to do that. So it really is sort of like a, a work product. That we do, I used it recently to transcribe those voice notes that our client had given us. We ultimately gave the other side, the other attorneys, the actual voice notes, but we did not provide the transcription. That's that's for our use. Really? They they can pay for their own transcription if they want.

Do you have any challenges or frustrations with Rev?
Betty Behrens: I just haven't used it, I think nearly enough to have stumbled across anything that will be challenging. It did exactly what I wanted it to do. With my transcription, which is great. So I certainly need to poke around and see what else Rev has to offer for sure. Yeah.

Would it be useful if whatever you use to record calls automatically synced up with Rev?
Betty Behrens: Yeah, definitely. Absolutely. Definitely. And again, since we don't ever use those out of office, their work product, it wouldn't be any sort of laws being broken by, I guess it wouldn't even be recording it, would it? I don't I don't know how that would work, but it doesn't seem to me that it would be any sort of law breaking thing, like I'm recording this conversation. But I would certainly appreciate an actual transcription versus a summary. And yeah, for sure, I would I would definitely use that product.

How are you recording your calls?
Betty Behrens: I don't.

I thought you mentioned that some client calls were recorded?
Betty Behrens: That that's with Chris when he's on with zoom. He he sort of does that. Yeah. As the managing partner. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm usually, sometimes I'm included on the call to and I'm on a, in another extension or whatever. But traditionally, he'll take the call with the expert because it's, he's a lawyer. And then I've got to rely on. Oh, this is what the doctor said and the zoom I summary of the call, which is never helpful. So.

Is there any features or functionalities that would make your life easier that you would like to see added to Rev?
Betty Behrens: Yeah, I'd have to again sort of poke around and see what's there now. Again, I would love I'm also I'm not an Excel person at all, so I find very challenging to actually create sort of a spreadsheet of medical bills, which is something we always have to produce in our cases. And everybody in my office does it differently. And so I would love something like that where I could just send in the bills and say, hey, you guys make me a pretty spreadsheet for it.

Where do you go to learn about new technology?
Betty Behrens: That's yeah, that all those things that's and that's where I learn it. I am on this paralegal committee with the injury board. And every month a bunch of paralegals get on a zoom conference and we have a topic usually like, oh, how are you handling this? And that's where we sort of share with each other. Oh, hey, have you guys tried Rev for this? Or Rev will go to injury board and say, hey, we're willing to put on a webinar about our product or DC trial lawyers just did a case debrief, for a significant jury verdict that came out. And I was on that and that was sponsored by somebody, obviously. So so that's really sort of how we're learning about these things in our little, small, tiny community of, of medical malpractice attorneys here in DC is just, hey, what are you using that got you that successful result? So that's yeah, that's sort of how.

Have you seen other companies work with Injury Board in that way?
Betty Behrens: Yeah, yeah. I think Soup.io, is courts them or wants their business a lot or, I think that's how I heard of Soup.io. Maybe that way, but. Yeah, a lot of the. Yeah.

Transcript
What prompted you to start using a tool like Rev?
Kelsey Whisler: It was actually one of the attorneys ideas. I only dabbled in it a little bit, and he was more focused on Rev. I don't know if Rev knows, but paralegals do all of the work, so sometimes the attorneys need a little help with their writing.

Where did the attorney find Rev?
Kelsey Whisler: You know, I'm not even sure he. I don't know if that was something that he got from maybe a Lexus Nexus employee or like, person that works there. Because he usually calls he he didn't do the research. In LexisNexis, he calls to say, hey, can you find this case law? And it's honestly terrible, but I assumed that he may have gotten that from them or somebody else in our law community.

What is the specific use case you had for using Rev?
Kelsey Whisler: So this one was to help assist with a response to a summary judgment. And I want to believe it was like a contract for summary judgment. Specifically, we have our stronger areas in law. Contracts is not my favorite by any means. So we've had a couple of personal injury summary judgments, which were pretty, which that was fine because we're pretty we use a lot of we do a lot of personal injuries, but we don't do a lot of contracts. So we just kind of needed some assistance in that area.

Was it an audio file provided to you by someone else, or was it used in some discovery?
Kelsey Whisler: It was used more of kind of. It was kind of, I guess, like for a deposition and a discovery.

Have you used Rev in other use cases beyond this one?
Kelsey Whisler: I've only used it in this one case. I believe we were going to use it in other cases too. That just hasn't really come up necessarily. But it's really just so we can point out things that were said and it's a lot easier. Like instead of trying to play it back on camera and like, and to get to get a faster response time, I guess with like the recordings.

Have you used other transcription tools before or how are you evaluating Rev?
Kelsey Whisler: We we've used I haven't used any other transcription like sites like Rev, I've used actual transcriptionists, but sometimes it can be hard because they're busy and then the turnaround time isn't great, so that's what makes it more difficult. But, yeah, it was a it was definitely just a. It was. They did a pretty good job, from what I could tell. Anyway, with that. So that was that was official for sure.

Why did you rank accuracy and ease of use as most important, and cost as least important?
Kelsey Whisler: I guess when you want things done, it doesn't really matter how much it's going to cost. If it's if it does an effective job and it's accurate and everything else, then I don't know that money should necessarily matter.

Are some of these costs that would be passed on to the client?
Kelsey Whisler: Yes. I mean, we could work it out where it's like, kind of to the client and kind of not, I guess, but. Sure. Where we're paying half and half, it kind of just depends on, you know, the immediate need. And if they got it to us in time or not.

Did you use the human transcription or the AI transcription?
Kelsey Whisler: I think I did, I think I did both, actually.

What do you suspect you might use Rev for going forward?
Kelsey Whisler: I would probably still use it for like, discovery or videos or anything. Honestly, I was really impressed with. I was impressed with the the time frame and everything going forward.

Has there anything that's been frustrating or challenging about using Rev so far?
Kelsey Whisler: I don't think so. I think it was pretty straightforward. And they gave a turnaround for the time, and that was really nice, too.

What other tools do you guys use?
Kelsey Whisler: We do use, we do use Clio and LexisNexis, which is just like Westlaw, but a hundred times better.

Why is LexisNexis a hundred times better than Westlaw?
Kelsey Whisler: I think it's easier to navigate than than Westlaw. I mean, I guess when I was in school, I only used Lexis. So the first time I saw Westlaw, I was like, I don't know what's going on in here, so.

Any other tools that you use?
Kelsey Whisler: Yeah, we actually just started using Dropbox. From my request, it's just a lot easier. And I think it's more efficient than using a flash drive, because that's how we would issue out discoveries. Download it all, scan it, and then send sitting on a flash drive when, you can just constantly update it through Dropbox. And so that was something that was pretty important. And it turns out it's like probably one of the more useful tools that we have.

Are there any features or functionalities you'd like to see added to Rev or improved?
Kelsey Whisler: I, I can't think of any, honestly. I mean, I, I thought it was really I don't, I don't want to say perfect, but I mean it worked out really well. It was easy to use. Like I said, the turnaround was good and even the I compared to the actual person doing it was, was just as good. So.

What package did you use or what pricing did you go with?
Kelsey Whisler: I want to say I paid by the minute. It was just because I wasn't sure how often we would use it. And whether it was something that we did want to continue using. So I think I just did, like the smallest plan available, so.

Would a legal-specific plan with extra privacy and security compliance be useful?
Kelsey Whisler: I think it would definitely be useful. If we had more cases that were specific to like, you know, needing those because a lot of depositions and stuff are already, you know, being accounted for. But we don't do a lot of interviews and stuff just at our office. I actually was in school to do transcription. And I timed out so I wasn't able to do it, and I had, like 0.5% left. So that was unfortunate, but it was it's definitely nice to have an option like Rev to take care of that. Transcripts especially especially when you're busy and you don't have time. I mean, a lot of times it takes 2 to 3 Three weeks, maybe. And that's the soonest with any other transcription?

If Rev was to create a legal package, what would you expect to make it useful and catered well to the legal industry?
Kelsey Whisler: Definitely the turnaround time and the availability and the accuracy. Those are probably the three most important, because you are just you're trying to. It's easier, like I said, to see the words instead of replaying it over and over Again. And so you want to make sure that they're what they said is what they said word for word. Because sometimes that could make or break a case. So.

Is turnaround time and availability about ensuring you have someone ready and dedicated for human transcription when you need it?
Kelsey Whisler: I think so, and it's not to say, you know, I think it's unrealistic to assume that one person is going to be available all the time for you. But like, if you had, you know, groups for if, if you buy a package, let's say with Rev and it's like 200 a month or whatever it is, then it would be like almost a guaranteed turnaround time for like depending on how long it is, you know, like have a certain like if it's 15 minutes, we'll have it to you in less than ten hours or. Yeah, yeah. Or something like that. Like something that gives you an idea of what the turnaround time is. So you can either expedite it or have anything. Or just so you'll be able to know when and provide that timeline to for a brief or whatever you need it for.

Would it be valuable if that package had transcriptionists trained in a law glossary for more accuracy on specific legal terms?
Kelsey Whisler: I don't know if that would necessarily be beneficial or not to them. I mean, it might make more sense. It's just hard because sometimes, you know, with spellings and stuff, that's always difficult. And so I want to say that there was a spot where you could put in, like the names and stuff like that, but sometimes they just throw a wrench in there and you're just, you're kind of trying to figure out what's going on. So.

Do you use AI today in your work at all?
Kelsey Whisler: I do not. I've just discovered how great ChatGPT is, but I have not used it. And it's not because I'm not. I don't want to believe. I think I'm a strong writer, so I don't know that it's that helpful for me, and I don't want to I guess count on that to be like. It would be a good fallback if I'm struggling with something, but I don't want to use it regularly.

If you were the CEO of Rev, what would you change to better serve a company like yours or to serve a role like yours as a paralegal?
Kelsey Whisler: Let's see here. I would give them a gold star every day until they did a great job. That's. It's hard to say. But I definitely would. Like I said, provide that timeline because I think that's. I mean, laws is literally on a timeline all the time. So I think it helps to have that type of information in regard to the timeline. So if I could provide a timeline for them and give them options to make their writing stronger, I, I probably would.

Is there any place that you engage with other paralegals - in-person events, digital events, forums, slack communities?
Kelsey Whisler: I have a few. I'm like friends with a few of the paralegals in town and wouldn't say necessarily friends, but acquaintances. I think we all kind of get along because we're all kind of in the same boat. I actually wish that there was, like, more kind of events for paralegals specifically to go to. I mean, they have the continued legal education, but most of those are by zoom. And most of them are for attorneys. So, yeah, it's it's definitely it would be nice to have the opportunity to, like, have a little meet and greets or, you know, things because sometimes it's nice to bounce ideas off of other paralegals that you might not know about.

What types of recordings are you using it for?
Daniella Buenrostro: So it's body cam footage and kind of just like iPhone recorded videos on someone's phone of like a conversation.

Do you mind giving me a little context on your law firm? How many lawyers? How much support staff?
Daniella Buenrostro: So I work at a family law firm in Pasadena. I would say total it's like 25 of us, attorneys, paralegals, legal support staff. There is five paralegals and ten attorneys and I think 520 total, five legal staff. Yeah. So I guess 20 of us together.

What was the first use? What triggered it? Were you using another tool before?
Daniella Buenrostro: Before we were doing it all in-house and it was just like very time consuming. So we started looking at like other outlets. I know that we tried to use like ChatGPT and that one wasn't as like, it didn't really work. So then my supervisors and the legal staff were like looking at other routes.

What is your role there?
Daniella Buenrostro: I'm a paralegal.

Did you look at any other tools, or how did you find out about Rev?
Daniella Buenrostro: We looked into ChatGPT and then we asked. I can't, I think we tried looking into like Adobe to see if Adobe had those capabilities in Microsoft, but no, I know that one of our staff members like I guess on a Google search like Rev.com came out and then we decided to try it and it was just like very cost efficient and like pretty accurate, because what we do is that we'll listen to the recordings, and then we'll read the transcripts to just make sure that it's like fully accurate.

Are you using just the AI or have you tested any of the human capability?
Daniella Buenrostro: No. We use like the human capability. We ordered like for like a person to like do the transcripts. But when we get the transcripts back, we'll sit down and we'll like listen to like the recordings and then kind of like make sure that it like matches correctly. Just to double check, I guess.

Who at your firm is using Rev? Is it all the paralegals? Is it everybody?
Daniella Buenrostro: I would say that it's mostly the paralegals.

What do you do with the transcripts after you get them back?
Daniella Buenrostro: So we download them and then all copy the entire transcript and I'll paste it onto pleading paper like on word. And then what I'll do is I'll change. So you know how like when you do get the transcripts, it's like Speaker one. Speaker two all like while I'm reading, while I'm listening to the video again, and making sure that it's accurate on the transcript, I'll change like speaker one to like the person's name who's talking. And that's kind of like the process.

What other tools does the company use?
Daniella Buenrostro: So we use Dropbox. We also use just like files like on desktop, like folders. And we use it's called carrot. It's like a legal software. It used to be called Zola, but I know that they changed it to carrot. So we that's like our legal software that kind of we do our billing and just everything is kind of like stems from that. And then we also use teams and like like outlook as like our emails.

Do any of the tools you use for your job use AI?
Daniella Buenrostro: I would say no they don't use I. But our software I don't know if this is I, but I know that our software carrot will have document templates that like per like it. You click on like your like clients like matter number and it pops up like the dashboard. And if you go and documents, you can merge a document template to fit like your clients like data. And then it'll highlight like what sections like you need to change to like kind of like cater it to like the specific like motion or like cleaning that you're doing. So we use that a lot like probably like every day.

Have you ever tested out the AI features within Rev?
Daniella Buenrostro: I have not.

Is there anything you can think of that would make your life easier? Besides speaker labels to make it easier to use, to make it faster, to use to be more specific to law?
Daniella Buenrostro: Well, yeah. Aside from the speaker thing, because I didn't know that feature. That's really helpful. I think that kind of making it a little bit easier to use, like visually sometimes, I feel like robe just looks a little bit like cluttered. So it's kind of making it like I guess like easier to use, like on the eye, like more simple. That would be helpful. And yeah, with if it's like able to like kind of like move towards like using it for like law and stuff, I guess like accuracy would be like really the most important. Sure. And being like up to date with like case laws and stuff like that.

Have you had any frustrations or challenges with Rev?
Daniella Buenrostro: No, I would say that they've it's been pretty pleasant, honestly. They've given it back to us like really fast. I don't think I would have had any like complaints. I guess the only complaint was the speaker stuff. But then, since I'm able to change it, that's not even a complaint.

How much are you using it today? Is it 10% of your cases that come through? 50%? And what would change or where do you think it will go in the next 3 to 6 months?
Daniella Buenrostro: Since we use it a lot for like transcripts, I definitely feel like it's like a case by case basis. I mean, I have like, we had this one case where we had like trial coming up and there was like three hours of just like body cam like off police officer videos. And it was like a lot of like video footage, that our clients, our client like submitted us. And then there would be other times where like we'll have clients where it's like like one of the parents is like secretly recording like an argument that they're having with like their ex, and they'll submit that. And that's probably like 30s or like 15 seconds. So I guess yeah, I guess it like varies, but definitely like when we have like cases kind of like going more towards like trials and like hearings and stuff, like leading up the weeks, like the week leading up to it would probably be using it like a lot more.

What comes to mind for you if you were to help Rev say, hey, here's what we need in a legal package that's more than just kind of a transcript?
Daniella Buenrostro: Yeah. I mean, like look, they have like this security data is like important. But I feel like since like my firm has like their own like files, like data, like filing system, I don't think that we would use it specifically like with our clients information and stuff, but I definitely think that it would be really helpful to be able to like kind of use it, utilize it to be able to like research, in a quick like time, because I feel like we usually like Westlaw and like Lexis, like there's like a lot like you could like search it up and there's just like a lot of different stuff. And sometimes it's like overwhelming and like we just like want like a specific answer with like stuff to like back it up and some it would be nice to have like a service where we could just like type in like a legal question and be able to get like a concise like accurate like, oh, this is this reason because of these like cases.

Is there anything about like the multiple speakers or maybe even multiple languages sometimes that they could create a specific kind of tool and package around for use with body cam?
Daniella Buenrostro: I guess I haven't used rev with different languages. Are they able to like transcribe like different languages?

They can do different languages. But I think they're working on is the challenge of when one video has two languages at the same time. Would you find that useful?
Daniella Buenrostro: Yeah. Because we had this like one case where there was like a body cam footage and they were talking to this couple and the grandma was there and she was speaking in Armenian and it just said like speaking in Armenian. It just didn't really like it wasn't like it didn't really kind of help with like getting what she was saying. So I guess like yeah, that that would help like a lot like if they're able to like differentiate like the different languages like in one video.

Do you have any feedback on Rev that I haven't asked about?
Daniella Buenrostro: I think that yeah, the language being able to differentiate different languages would be really helpful. And yeah, I guess like kind of making it more of like also more of like a research tool would be really helpful. That's like accurate and reliant.

Transcript
Drew: Can you talk about what prompted you to evaluate Rev? Were you using anything beforehand? Was there a specific need?
Leila: I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots.
And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about.
Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. So it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the AI. It kind of does a little bit of that. I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript.
Drew: Can you identify a couple of different use cases for how you use Rev today and what types of triggers or keywords you'd be looking for?
Leila: A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? So ""look around,"" ""do you mind?"" Things like that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening.
But there's lots of different scenarios. Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. So certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, so punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered.
I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to places like Westlaw or LexisNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is a DUI case and then have it pull from a database that would search those terms.
Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing discovery. So sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area so we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners like me or very, very small firms. And so that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge?
And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. So they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers so much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for.
Drew: Is there a scenario where you have uploaded audio content, and it would be useful for you to add other content and then have Rev's AI search among the aggregate of all that content?
Leila: Yeah, I mean the more information the better. The more they can analyze the evidence, the better.
Drew: You mentioned you didn't use it for a while and then took on some more serious cases. Was ""serious"" related to the depth of evidence or the amount of materials, or what makes Rev worth using on these cases but not others?
Leila: That's actually a really good question. I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. It's actually more about the volume of the evidence.
I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many.
The stakes for a DUI are lower. So if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, so to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not like we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And so I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidence.
Drew: Is ""serious"" defined by the penalty?
Leila: Yeah, that's usually what I mean by penalty. The typical way is felony versus misdemeanor, but it depends what it is. A felony theft charge, you could argue it's less serious than a misdemeanor domestic violence charge on your record. Generally, yes. I look at the time, the exposure, if it's a felony, if it's a misdemeanor. Also the nature of the crime, is it just a drug offense? Is it a property offense or is it an offense where there's a tangible victim, violent offenses, anything sexual in nature, which I usually don't touch, those are inherently more serious.
Drew: And is it accurate that because it's more serious, it's worth spending more time with the materials and going deeper?
Leila: To an extent. When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through.
Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy. Or for DV cases - Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration. That's how I would fight that kind of a case.
However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence.
Drew: Where can Rev have the most value? Where can it help the most?
Leila: I think equally. I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. So they probably get more bang for their buck that way.
Drew: Did you evaluate any other options before you started using Rev?
Leila: No, I'm lazy. No, I just was like, this worked for me in the past. They did a good enough job. I did notice last time there's quite a few errors I think that I didn't do the human, I think there's one that you can get humans to look it over. I think they just need to crisp it up a little bit. Voice recognition technology or whatever they use. There was a quite a bit of error. Also the distinction between speakers. Sometimes there was two speakers. I thought there was three.
So again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. So voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, like something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just so I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, so sometimes it's not like you have a microphone.
Drew: In the areas where you noticed it was not accurate, do you think that's related to specific names, certain types of things they were talking about, or was it body cam related to distance where the quality of the audio got lower?
Leila: It was audio quality and also people talking over each other, which happens a lot.
Drew: Do you use any other tools like a case management tool or any other software for your practice?
Leila: I don't. Clio tried to get me pretty hard. My caseload isn't big enough really now for me to do that. And I like a hands-on approach. I've Dropbox for all my files, but I also actually have paper files still. It's helpful for me to visualize and see, and I like taking them into court so I don't have the laptop out and I'm a little bit more hands-on like that. Again, I'm a solo practitioner. If I started to take on staff, then I think that it would be inevitable. I'd have to jump over to something like that. I know Clio is well used or widely used and generally liked by my colleagues.
Drew: Is there anything else that would make your life or job easier? It can be AI related or not.
Leila: I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. So let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they could easily give you that.
I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of like a cheat sheet for what you feed it. So if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript.
So if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. So these are all the speakers we identified. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. So if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O. And then so I can find with each witness where they are so I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful.
And then do the same thing with those concepts. So any mention of guns, or an overall take of all the files, rather it just be file by file.
Drew: How would you rank these factors: cost, accuracy, data security and compliance, ease of use, specific features, and speed?
Leila: I think specific accuracy has to be number one. Specific features would be third because that would be so helpful, but if it's not accurate, then who cares? I find the costs pretty reasonable. And with lawyers, we just pass the costs along to our clients. So I mean, we don't want it to be exorbitant, but we are not paying for it out of pocket.
Drew: Does the billing make sense? I've had other legal clients who actually charge per case, not a subscription. Would you prefer it to be billed in a different way that's more easily passed on?
Leila: Interesting question because there's definitely benefits of both. I would say that the downside of per-case is that it's more paperwork. So I say I pass it along and then immediate thought was, have I actually though? Because am I keeping good enough track of all of my costs? Or if a transcript is five bucks, it is more expensive for me to go and track it all than it is to just let that go.
Also, if it's a subscription, you can write it off on your taxes and you don't have to continually track it, it's just done. So I think it should be an option. Why not just do both?
Drew: Do you have any frustrations while using Rev?
Leila: I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. That is a little frustrating, but I'm not using it right now as gospel. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it, I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99%, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. I could use it in a hearing. So that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more.
Drew: Would it be valuable for them to identify when it's less accurate and offer you, ""Hey, people are talking over each other or the volume is distorted for this 20% section, would you like to use a human to go through it?""
Leila: Yes. I think some kind of indicator where maybe they do it in however, five-minute chunks and then analyze the accuracy and then say these are your problem areas, like a red flag. That's a great idea, but I feel like they can improve the technology. I know it's out there, so it's just applying the technology to it.
I think that makes so much more sense. That's just a bandaid to the ultimate issue, and they're going to lose people if they don't focus on that. If another platform comes out that is far more accurate. I mean, if I were them and I would be making these decisions, I would really put all my eggs in that basket, or not all of them, but I would focus very much on that.

Drew Giovannoli: What I have here is that you are at Vandenberg Law Firm, which I assume is your last name is your law firm, and you've hired or you've purchased Rev, and you've used it in the past couple quarters. Is that accurate?
Alex Vandenberg: Yes. That's correct.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there any other partners or paralegals at your law firm?
Alex Vandenberg: No. So I run my own firm, and I am contracting with other firms. That's where I pick up my projects.
Drew Giovannoli: How have you used Rev so far?
Alex Vandenberg: So, I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was, with court reporters, sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So, I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be 100% perfect, just something that I can refer to. Or also to have something to refer to in real time if there's multiple parties, and there's a lot of crosstalk going on. And, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or, I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it. I want to just be able to look up and see, oh, yeah, it was 146.5, or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So, I started with another online recording and transcription website. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping, basically, pretty much everything. So then I thought, ""There's gotta be a better solution. There's gotta be something more accurate."" And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more towards, geared towards legal field rather than just general recording, so I thought, ""Hey, that's perfect."" And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or, something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X many minutes. That's well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes... Unlike the previous one, which I'll remember, I was able to download the app and use it on my iPad. So, I would have my laptop, just like I have it with you. I would have my iPad right next to me, and I would be running the Rev app. And I can just look over on my screen and see it going on line by line. So, I really like that. But I would say my biggest issue, and something that's been happening every single time, whenever we go on break, and I hit pause, and then we come back from a break, and I resume, it starts writing me an essay. It doesn't separate it anymore.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything else that's like a frustration for you, an obstacle about it?
Alex Vandenberg: I have recently noticed that when I'm... 'Cause it says that I can record even when I'm offline, but it doesn't give me a transcript. It only gives me the sound wave. So the other day, I was working remotely out of a client's office, and his Wi-Fi was down, so we were using the hotspot off my phone, which wasn't really great for that position. So, to save on bandwidth, we just shut everything off, and we just both used my laptop, and we had a Zoom video depo. So, I didn't connect my iPad to save some bandwidth, and the only thing I could get is the sound wave. Now, I know it recorded it, and then later, it transcribed it, but it would have been helpful, since it's just using the voice coming out of my speakers, if it could still write it out as we go.
Drew Giovannoli: That's great.
Alex Vandenberg: And yeah. Other than that... Oh, I did have a question. I was wondering, since it works off of the iPad speaker, or my computer speaker, unless I specifically hit pause. Like, there were several times where I didn't hit pause during my break, just so it doesn't interrupt and write me an essay. And then, I noticed, when I came back, it picked up my side conversation with my colleague. So, I was wondering, and then... So, I would have to go back and edit it. So, I was wondering if there is a way, like, let's say I'm using my iPad, to somehow connect it so that it doesn't record the noise coming out of my speakers so it can record directly. 'Cause sometimes it will be better if I can put my headphones on and still have it recorded. But if I do that, it'll just pick up my voice and not the sound of the depo, or the sound of the Zoom call. So, I'm wondering if there is a way, if... Maybe I'm just... Maybe I didn't read the instructions, or if there's something that can be built later on. If there's a way to connect it so that it records and takes the audio directly from within the Zoom meeting instead of me playing it out loud through speakers, and it picking up the sound coming out of my speakers.
Drew Giovannoli: Yeah. I don't know the answer, but it's a great question, and I'll relate to them.
Alex Vandenberg: 'Cause that also degrades the quality a bit. But, yeah, it would help me if I can have my headphones on and still get everybody's voice.
Drew Giovannoli: What other tools do you use, like case management software or anything else?
Alex Vandenberg: So it depends on what law firm I'm associating with at the moment. But for case management, I've used Filevine. Actually, that's the more prevalent one on my last three clients over the last year and a half. They all set me up on Filevine within their infrastructures. Or, if I work on the defense side... So, I do... Let me back up. I do personal injury. So, I've done plaintiff side. Now, I'm focusing more on working with defense firms. They would set me up with like, juries for their billing, for me to put in my hours, based on what I work on. As far as case management, like I said, Filevine's been the predominant one. Here, at my current client, they just use like... They're pretty simple. I mean, I don't want to simplify it like that, but they just use like, for file storage, like the F drive.
Drew Giovannoli: SharePoint?
Alex Vandenberg: SharePoint, yeah. There you go. So, that's where... So, they would just give me remote access into their files so I can access them remotely.
Drew Giovannoli: Have you used Filevine's AI capabilities, any of Rev's AI capabilities?
Alex Vandenberg: I have not. I mean, I've used the summarization for the transcript to give me... To find specific keywords or find specific sections within the recording. Other than that, I haven't really explored other AI functions outside of that, which is on my to-do list when I get to it.
Drew Giovannoli: On the subject of improvement, since you thought Rev was supposed to be a little more legal-oriented, I noticed that it has sometimes hard time picking up specific legal jargon. And I thought maybe there could be some sort of dictionary included within so that it's picking up words that sound like it are more like this. For example, let me see. There was a... Oh, yeah. Somebody raised an objection. Asked an answer. And I see the transcription says asset and asset. And I'm thinking, well, like basic objections, vague, argumentative, asked and answered should be built in so that the system knows when something like that sounds like the objection, it's probably this.
Alex Vandenberg: Also, I was wondering on the subject of improvement, since I thought Rev was supposed to be a little more legal-oriented, I noticed that it has sometimes hard time picking up specific legal jargon. And I thought maybe there could be some sort of dictionary included within so that it's picking up words that sound like it are more like this. For example, let me see. There was a... Oh, yeah. Somebody raised an objection. Asked and answered. And I see the transcription says asset and asset. And I'm thinking, well, like basic objections, vague, argumentative, asked and answered should be built in so that the system knows when something like that sounds like the objection, it's probably this.
Drew Giovannoli: In terms of keeping things legal specific, are there any other areas you think they could improve to make it more legal-centric? Either integrations with other software, certain formatting that you need?
Alex Vandenberg: I mean, mainly just Word and PDF if I'm trying to edit stuff. Other than that, I can't really think of other formatting that would help me in my daily work.
Drew Giovannoli: When you looked at tools, you mentioned that Rev speaks to the legal audience and that they've got a focus there. What were your criteria? What was important to you as you looked for a tool to make it worth your time?
Alex Vandenberg: So I needed a real-time transcript that runs along as people are speaking. There are tools that record and then you upload it and then they give you a transcript. But I wanted something that's real, that's running in real time that I can just look over and, like I said, I can scroll 10 lines ahead to see what was the word I missed. Something that's more accurate in picking up what's being said so that I don't have to spend hours correcting every single word from not just people's names, but everyday sentences. And I like that it had separate app that I don't have to... 'Cause if I have my Zoom on full screen, it's hard for me to like tab over. So it's, I like that I can just have it on an app separately and I prefer running it on my iPad rather than having it on my laptop in the background. And then, you know, notification comes in and it might affect things like it did with the prior one. So yeah, those were... And also, I wanted as little limitations as possible because I've had depos that went for 30 minutes and I've had depos that went for five hours and up. Now those, they don't happen often, but I need to be able to capture the whole thing. So, a generous budget of minutes, or not a timer lockout like some like free packages do is also something that was important to me. And I don't mind paying for it, of course within reason. If it's 30 bucks a month that's something different than it's 300 bucks a month. So yeah, 30 bucks a month is fine. But yeah, something that has a capability of going for as long as I need it to, for hours if need be.
Drew Giovannoli: When you get the transcript, when you finish with that transcript or it's fully received, what do you do then? Are you downloading into the cloud?
Alex Vandenberg: Yeah, I would download it. I would download, let's say the Word version and then it highlights it speaker one, speaker two, speaker three. So then I would just change the names to whoever was speaking at that time. Oh, that was also another thing that was a little bit frustrating. While I see the transcript running, it just gives me timestamps, but it doesn't break it up into different speakers. So while it's running, it says, one hour, 52, 53 seconds, one hour, 52, 54 seconds. And it goes like line by line, but it doesn't like separate it into speakers until the transcript's fully uploaded, generated and downloaded. So, which was something that the previous site was doing, except their audio picking up system was horrible. But it was nice where I could see speaker one or if I put in the name, you know, Drew and then paragraph from you and then Alex, and then sentences from me and then back to Drew.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you think it's accurate enough once you download it afterwards and it's just the live streaming issue? Or is it always not where you need it to be accuracy-wise?
Alex Vandenberg: There are... I mean, the accuracy could be improved just on... Let me see if I have one. Just yesterday, and that was one that I recorded offline and then had it uploaded. It created a chunk of time for the court reporter and the client and me. So like there's one block and I can say, ""My name is Zelda. If you could please raise your right hand, solemnly state that the testimony you're about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, nothing much, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"" ""Yes, I do."" ""Thank you, sir. Okay, the purpose of going on record today..."" So there's clearly multiple speakers, but it captured it as speaker one.
Drew Giovannoli: Got it.
Alex Vandenberg: So yeah, if there is a... And I know sometimes people speak over each other, so even for human court reporter, it's hard to break it up. But there are times where the conversation is properly spaced out where people don't talk over each other, yet when I get the transcript, it's all blocked into... speaker one, and then I just have to separate the sentences okay. ""Yes, I do. Do you solemnly swear it, speaker one?"" ""Yes, I do, speaker two."" ""Okay, thank you. Back to speaker one.""
Drew Giovannoli: When you have the transcripts, are you only for internal use, or are you ever sharing it, submitting it, using it externally?
Alex Vandenberg: I would share it within my team, with my coworkers. Or let's say I'm associating in on a case, then I would share it with the attorney that's primary that's handling on the case. So, I would share it internally. But my primary purpose is just for my own reference. For me to be able to keep track while I'm in the depo. And for me to be able to reflect on it immediately after the depo when I'm providing, let's say, the supervising attorney or the handling attorney. When I'm providing them the summary of, ""Hey, I attended your depo. This is what happened."" So that's, so primarily for my own use. But I've shared it with them before too, especially if there is some notable testimony that I want to highlight. ""Can you believe this guy said?"" And I want word-for-word.
Drew Giovannoli: What integrations could Rev create that would help you with your job?
Alex Vandenberg: Maybe, like I said, having a plug-in directly into Zoom. Because I think 99% of stuff nowadays happens on Zoom, whether it's hearings or depositions. Now, I know a lot of people use their favorite court reporting agency, and then they... But it ends up mostly on Zoom. So, if there was a button on Zoom, just like you have record button. If there was a plug-in you can install, Rev button, that gives you the ability to run a transcript. That would be helpful. And that way, hopefully it'll pick up the sound directly from within the hearing, or within the Zoom meeting. Rather than just me having to manually...
Drew Giovannoli: I just sent you the link in the Zoom, that is information on their Zoom integration.
Alex Vandenberg: Oh, okay. So, again, back to me, that's something that I haven't heard properly.
Drew Giovannoli: If you do integrate it into your Zoom, will it notify everybody else that it's being live transcribed for one of the users?
Alex Vandenberg: Now, if I do, and this is theoretical, and I'm sure the answer will be in there. If I do integrate it into my Zoom, will it notify everybody else that it's being live transcribed for one of the users? Or will it...
Drew Giovannoli: I believe so.
Alex Vandenberg: Okay. That shouldn't be a problem. I was just curious if other people are gonna be questioning me. So, but I'm expecting if somebody says, ""Hey, Alex, what are you doing?""
Drew Giovannoli: Yeah, I think it shows up as another participant.
Alex Vandenberg: Oh, I see. Okay, that's fine. So that would actually solve the problem of the... Or maybe it might improve the audio quality and help it parse it up better. Okay. I learned something new today.
Drew Giovannoli: Rev has an increasing amount of functionality around not just summaries, but setting up templates. And I'm just curious, in your... As you imagine how to use Rev going forward for depositions, is there anything that you would find really useful? Beyond the transcript, what could it do to that transcript that would make your job easier?
Alex Vandenberg: Maybe if it's, like for example, specifically for me, when I'm dealing with personal injury. Usually the depositions get broken up into several categories. The person's background, the accident itself, the medical treatment, and their life afterwards. Whether it's for most parties and for most types of accidents. Whether it's somebody slipping at Target or somebody being pancaked by an 18-wheeler, it's the same procedure. So, if I could maybe set up categories, or maybe tell the summary to look out for these four issue areas. Or however many there may be for a specific attorney's preference. If I could teach it, you know, when you're doing me... When you're writing me the summary. ""Tell me about the person's prior accidents or prior injuries, history, whatever was said. Tell me about medical treatment. Like, look for keywords of doctor this, doctor that. And summarize medical treatment."" Like, I don't know if that's too specific? Or if I can put in keywords. Search for the keywords accident, then highlight everything that the guy said with the word ""accident"". Although, accident might be too general. But let's say I go through the guy's medical records and there is Dr. Smith. And then I would just put in a prompt saying, ""Highlight everything about Dr. Smith that's being said."" Or point it out in the summary. Let's say Dr. Smith performed a surgery that I'm arguing was not necessary. And plaintiff's attorney says it's absolutely necessary. And we might be going back and forth several times over what Dr. Smith did or didn't do. So, kind of, instead of me downloading the transcript and then control F and trying to figure it out. If in the summary it could focus on whatever the hook is that I would ask for it to search for.
Drew Giovannoli: That's great.
Alex Vandenberg: I think that would simplify my processing of the transcript. Other than that. Yeah. I can't think of anything else.

Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: Can you confirm that you are at Vayman & Teitelbaum PC?
Jenny Ohsberg: Yes.
Drew Giovannoli: And your title is Executive Director?
Jenny Ohsberg: Yes it is.
Drew Giovannoli: What does that role mean at your company and what are you responsible for?
Jenny Ohsberg: Sure. So we are a family law firm, so we handle family law and probate. In my role specifically, I help oversee the non-legal side of the team, the admin team, and help run operations, where a team of around 25 to 30, give or take. And so we've grown substantially. And so my role kind of covers a lot of things, just given the size of our company. So, I oversee the sales team and handle HR and implement new software and kind of do whatever is needed. So it varies quite a bit day to day, week to week.
Drew Giovannoli: How many people are at your firm?
Jenny Ohsberg: So right now we're at about 25, but we're looking to hire, so we typically are more in the 30 range. We're just kind of low right now.
Drew Giovannoli: What's the split of legal professionals versus legal support?
Jenny Ohsberg: So the legal team is a little over half of our staff, and then we have a sales team, a billing team, and then a couple on the admin side.
Drew Giovannoli: When did you start using Rev?
Jenny Ohsberg: It was a couple of years ago that we started using Rev. It was super helpful to us to have a way to transcribe phone calls. When we it started when we had an attorney leave our firm, and we realized they held a bunch of information that we needed, and so we record all of our phone calls. And so we pulled a bunch of phone calls and had them transcribed so that we can pass that information along to the remaining legal team and any new attorneys so that they would be caught up on the cases and not have to have clients relay information, you know, that they already have relayed. So that was sort of how it started. It was a lot quicker for us to have the, those calls transcribed and allow somebody to just read through them rather than having to sit down and listen to an entire phone call. So that's sort of where it started. And that's primarily our use for Rev is for that sort of a thing where, you know, we're looking to share information with the team so that a client doesn't have to repeat themselves.
Drew Giovannoli: Are these essentially sales calls or intake calls for actual use as evidence?
Jenny Ohsberg: So they're client calls. So it's after somebody has hired us, they've met with an attorney, or maybe they've talked to a paralegal and they've relayed information regarding their case to that person. So it's all after they have hired us. And, you know, sometimes it's evidence, sometimes it's just, you know, conversational type stuff. And we want to know what did the attorney advise the person to do or not do or, you know, just sort of what was discussed in that phone call.
Drew Giovannoli: Were you involved in choosing Rev and did you look at any other options?
Jenny Ohsberg: I was involved in it, but it was years ago now, so I honestly don't remember if we had looked at other options. It was sort of. It seemed like the best option. It seemed really easy to use, and, you know, it was a good price and all of that. So I don't remember us really feeling like we needed to shop around much beyond that. It fit our needs.
Drew Giovannoli: Can you rank these six criteria by importance: speed, cost, accuracy, security, ease of use and features?
Jenny Ohsberg: So, for us the most important thing was speed and ease of use. And then I would say cost definitely ranks up there. Security is always something that we're concerned about, just given the nature of our business. So I would say accuracy would be next after security and then features would be last.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there any specific use of Rev that is geared towards legal that's important to you or that you wish it had?
Jenny Ohsberg: Not necessarily in the sense of formatting, but we use a case management system called Clio. So one thing I could think of is if it integrates with Clio, so that when you transcribe something, it just automatically is added to the client file. That would be helpful. So I don't know if you guys do integrations, but that could be something we love integrating. Whatever we can just to make things as streamlined as possible and remove human error if possible.
Drew Giovannoli: Can you walk me through any of the other integrations you have outside of Rev?
Jenny Ohsberg: Clio integrates with quite a few things. Like we have it integrated with Dropbox. That's how we store all of our files. And so we have it connected to that. We use Google for email and calendar. It's connected to those I know. It has an ability to connect with other things as well, but we haven't quite explored yet. And then we also have it connected to our CRM for potential new clients, which is LawMatics. So we like to have things kind of flow as much as possible.
Drew Giovannoli: What is LawMatics?
Jenny Ohsberg: It's a legal specific potential new client management system. So it houses all of the information of potential new clients, and then once they become a client, it moves that information over to our case management system, Clio.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you use any AI tools or functionality?
Jenny Ohsberg: Not really. I know that our phone system has our phone system's Ring Central. I know they have an AI capability to kind of take notes on phone calls, but we haven't really used that quite yet. I think it's a new feature.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there a specific reason you haven't used it?
Jenny Ohsberg: It's more of an accuracy thing. I've heard from the team that it doesn't always recognize different callers, so the notes get confusing when it gives you notes, but it's not clear who's saying what.
Drew Giovannoli: What would be a multi-speaker scenario in your use case?
Jenny Ohsberg: Typically there's only two speakers. But in our world when we have somebody call the front desk and then that call is transferred to somebody else, the original person that answered the phone is not on the call anymore, but it doesn't seem like the phone company recognizes that there's a handoff, if that makes sense. So it just gets confusing because it says like Speaker one, Speaker two and you just can't tell who's who, I guess. I haven't done it personally. I've just heard from the team that that was the complaint.
Drew Giovannoli: When you get the transcript back from Rev, what do you do with it?
Jenny Ohsberg: So once it's completed, we send it to the legal team. A legal team consists of an attorney, a paralegal, and a legal assistant. The legal assistant saves it to the client file and in Dropbox. And then the attorney reviews it from there.
Drew Giovannoli: Is it ever submitted to court or shared with anybody else, or is it for internal use only?
Jenny Ohsberg: Typically it's just internal use. I can't think of an occasion that it's been used in court.
Drew Giovannoli: When it's saved in Dropbox, is it saved as a Word document?
Jenny Ohsberg: As a Word document in Dropbox, it's saved as a Word document in Dropbox.
Drew Giovannoli: Is it all manually reviewed with no searching done with any other tool?
Jenny Ohsberg: Correct.
Drew Giovannoli: Who manages the Rev process?
Jenny Ohsberg: So usually I'm the one that would pull the calls, but since I'm an admin, the rest of the team doesn't have access to them. So I would pull the call, upload it to Rev, receive the transcript and send it to the team, and then they take it from there.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there any challenges or frustrations you face with Rev today?
Jenny Ohsberg: No, I don't think so. I know that it feels like the cost has gone up quite a bit since we first started. So it kind of limits what we would want to use it for, because there's times where it's an hour long phone call or, you know, an hour and a half. And so it makes it a little pricey to do it that way. So that would be the only thing. You know, it has been a challenge lately.
Drew Giovannoli: Are you using human transcription or have you tried AI transcription?
Jenny Ohsberg: We have not tried AI. We've only done human transcription.
Drew Giovannoli: What prevents you from using AI transcription?
Jenny Ohsberg: Honestly, I didn't know it was an option, so I didn't see that there was a choice between the two. So I wouldn't say that we wouldn't use it. I just didn't know it was available. So once we try it, I would just need to see that it's pretty accurate and then we'd be happy to use it.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were in charge of Rev, what would you change to better serve a company like yours?
Jenny Ohsberg: Good question. I feel like, I mean, it works well, it's easy to use, so I would say, like, since I didn't even know that they use AI now and that, you know, brings down the cost, I would maybe promote that a little bit more or make it more obvious on the website, just to know, to allow people to have that option more visible. But yeah, other than adding some integrations, I think that would be the biggest thing for me is just connecting it to things so that it's not sort of a standalone, you know, it would be more involved. I mean, if you connected with something like Ring Central where, you know, there was a button or something that when you're downloading the call, you could just send it to Rev, you know, have it integrated with Ring Central to automatically make that transcription for you through Rev. That would be super helpful.
Drew Giovannoli: Are there any other integrations with Clio or other legal tools that would be useful?
Jenny Ohsberg: Those are the programs that we use. So those would be super helpful to us. I'm sure there's plenty others, you know, that would like there's competitors for Clio, there's competitors for Ring Central, things like that. So any of those I'm sure would be helpful as well. But yeah, I think just kind of connecting it with as many things as possible, you know, just kind of gets it out there, keeps it front and center. So you remember to use it.

Transcript
Nick Delgado: Can you briefly describe your role in the company?
Victoria Hardy: I work with an attorney here in New Orleans, Wealth Planning Law Group. He likes me to take videos and stuff like that. So he likes me to record off the web app, and then like that will transcribe the video. So I don't have to go in and watch the video and do it all myself. So having the app definitely helps with that.
Nick Delgado: How many employees overall are there?
Victoria Hardy: It's him, me who I am, his intake specialist and marketing, and then a paralegal named Monique.
Nick Delgado: Was it the attorney that recommended that you use Rev?
Victoria Hardy: No I found it myself. He sent me a bunch of videos and he told me to find something to transcribe them, and I was just googling and doing the App Store on my phone, and I found this app, and I gave it a shot, and it's been working perfectly. I sent him the transcripts, and he's like that was amazing.
Nick Delgado: What prompted you to evaluate transcription services like Rev?
Victoria Hardy: Him needing to transcribe any of the videos or anything that he needs. And the app just helps me do that instead of going through the video myself and writing notes and doing that manually, it would be better just to do the app and then give him like the highlights of the video and a summary. You know, basically like a summary and then like the key points and it helps, like, when I send it to him, he thought that was more organized, like the way they did that.
Nick Delgado: Were you manually transcribing things before Rev?
Victoria Hardy: No, actually it just started working for him recently, like in the beginning of the year, and he never really needed me to transcribe anything before until that project he sent me. So when he said to find something to transcribe it, that's when I started to Google, like the best app to do that. And I downloaded a few and the other ones I really didn't care for. But this one was like, you know, like they gave the key like the highlight of what the topic was and the summary and the key points, and none of the other apps that I downloaded and tried did that.
Nick Delgado: How many other apps did you download?
Victoria Hardy: I want to say like maybe two other ones. It wasn't much. And then a prior person who worked before recommended some other app or like something online, just like type in Google. I don't think they had an app. And what she recommended didn't really work out either.
Nick Delgado: Do you remember any of the names of the other contenders?
Victoria Hardy: I downloaded Wave. Transcribe audio to text, live caption. And I think I can't remember the one that she recommended, but that wasn't an app. It was like, through like, you have to type through Google.
Nick Delgado: What were your expectations for how a transcription service would support the work that you're doing?
Victoria Hardy: Honestly, when I first downloaded it and started to record it, I thought it was just to give like what the speaker was saying in the audio. I didn't think it would be like so organized and more detailed. Like, you know how like I said, like the key points, the summary and all that. I didn't know to be like that. I thought it was supposed to be like, you know, what the speaker was saying in the video and then like literally that into text. I didn't know what it was, which was way more helpful for me and my boss.
Nick Delgado: Were there criteria that were important to you when evaluating the vendors?
Victoria Hardy: No, not necessarily. I just wanted really just someone to just transcribe the speaker voice into text. And it went way beyond what I thought it would.
Nick Delgado: Can you help me rank these criteria in terms of priority: accuracy, ease of use, speed, data security and compliance, specific features, and cost?
Victoria Hardy: Definitely accuracy would be important. Ease of use. Speed. Data security and compliance. Specific features and costs.
Nick Delgado: Tell me a little bit more about ease of use. What does that look like for you?
Victoria Hardy: So my boss likes a lot of AI technology nowadays. And some of the programs he wanted we have to cancel because it was too hard to learn, but it was more they had just like you had to do like a lot of training to learn their software. So something easy and understanding to use, like the app that I downloaded for Rev, it was very obviously like anybody can do it. It's very self-explanatory.
Nick Delgado: Did you have any needs or evaluation criteria that are specific to the legal industry?
Victoria Hardy: No.
Nick Delgado: How did Rev align with the needs and the evaluation criteria that you had going into it?
Victoria Hardy: Just transcribing the stuff that I needed to send to my boss.
Nick Delgado: Was there anything that stood out compared to your expectations?
Victoria Hardy: Yeah, like I said, like how they went into like the detail of like what the topic was because that is record multiple videos. He sent me and each one like they had like, I forget what the videos were about, but let's say like they're talking about, for example, for my boss says he's an attorney for estate planning and long term care. So like they would highlight the estate planning and then they would go into key points and then like a summary and then same thing for like long term care. It would highlight that big at the top. That's what the topic should be about. And then the summary and then like key points. So that was what mainly stood out to me because I wasn't expecting it to be exactly like that, which I really liked and my boss really liked.
Nick Delgado: Were there any shortcomings compared to your expectations?
Victoria Hardy: No, not at all.
Nick Delgado: What tipped the scales in choosing Rev over some of the other apps that you downloaded?
Victoria Hardy: Basically the other apps kind of did what I thought the app would do is kind of just transcribe the exact video speaker, its voice and text. It didn't even really go into detail, like, you know, like the summary, the key points, stuff like that. It just transcribed. You literally just transcribe the video to text.
Nick Delgado: At the firm who is using Rev and for what tasks?
Victoria Hardy: That would be just me and to transcribe any videos or even like when I'm on a zoom with a client sometimes. I mean, I know I have fireflies that report. I think that's what you added fireflies to say. Yeah, we have that too. Or even when I'm in a meeting with him himself. And he's like giving me like my tasks. I like just to have like because sometimes fireflies don't always go on our zoom meetings. For some reason. I don't know why, but my backup would be the Rev for sure. And like if he assigns me any task or anything like that, I can go back to that and have it. I mean, I'm the one that mainly uses it because I don't think he I mean anything that he would need to use it for. It would just be him sending it to me to do.
Nick Delgado: Tell me a little bit more about how you see the difference between fireflies and Rev.
Victoria Hardy: I mean I know fireflies, you can like go play back the actual video. Obviously with Rev, you just transcribe it. So there's not going to be a video, but they're pretty the same. I don't really go back though with fireflies and like look at that. I like to go with the rev app and you know, I think it's just more detailed and sense of fireflies. And it's more handy because it's an app on your phone. I think fireflies has an app. I want to go searching on my emails, you know, because I have to go searching my emails for that meeting that I had, and then I have to go look. And then I don't think fireflies also has like the key points like Rev has either because sometimes like when I'm looking for something, I have to like search in the little fireflies app to pull up that audio. And it just kind of frustrates me. So the rev app is much better.
Nick Delgado: What do you do with the Rev transcripts after you receive them?
Victoria Hardy: I copy and paste, and then I'll just send it to my boss and say, this is the transcription of your video that you requested me to look at.
Nick Delgado: Do you have any visibility into what he does with it after he receives it from you?
Victoria Hardy: Well usually he'll probably send it to because I know he has like other attorneys. For like with that one specific project I did, he sent me a bunch of videos and then I had to send the transcription to him. And then I think he just forwarded it to his other attorneys that needed to look at the videos also. And I don't think any of them had time to like look, sit down and like watch the all like 6 or 8 videos. So me sending the transcription was just I guess he just forwarded to all of them like that.
Nick Delgado: Are there other tools that you're using in tandem with Rev?
Victoria Hardy: No, I don't think so. I know, I mean, I don't know if you would consider chat GPT or whatever it's called as one of the. I know he likes that though chat GPT and then other ones are just like softwares like I don't know if you ever heard of Clio Grow or Automator. I know he has those and a few other ones, but like the amount that he has is crazy. And now he wants me to go back and like cancel a bunch of them.
Nick Delgado: Is Rev integrated with any of these other tools, or are you manually taking the transcription and then uploading it into other tools?
Victoria Hardy: Yeah. It'll just be like I just usually just copy and paste it on my email and send it to him.
Nick Delgado: Are there any ways Rev's features enhance your workflow?
Victoria Hardy: Oh yeah. Much faster. I would have to be sitting down watching like an Hour video for each each of the eight videos. So the fact that it can transcribe it and not even five minutes, it's amazing. So definitely saves me like a lot of time with that aspect that's great.
Nick Delgado: Have you encountered any challenges or frustrations while using Rev?
Victoria Hardy: No. Well, actually, I just fixed it because I had no idea this was an option, but I did not like my phone would always shut off when I was recording something, or even like if I got a call. That's another thing. When I get a call, when I'm transcribing something, it would like stop. That's the only thing I probably can kind of get frustrated. I don't know if there's a feature where you can turn it off, but I know that if your phone turns off, I just fix it in the app before we got on the meeting, actually, because I was trying to mess with the app and it says prevent Auto lock. The only thing is it's a phone calls. For some reason, every time I get a phone call, it stops the recording.
Nick Delgado: Are you using Rev exclusively on your phone or do you ever use the desktop browser version?
Victoria Hardy: Yeah I usually use it on my phone and like whatever I need to record to be on my desktop browser.
Nick Delgado: Are there specific features or functionalities you would like to see added to Rev or improved?
Victoria Hardy: No, I would like the thing about the phone call though. Yeah. And like it stops the whole thing. That was very. My fiance was like blowing up my phone. I was like, you keep messing up my transcription thing. Please stop calling me.
Nick Delgado: What role does AI play in your day to day work?
Victoria Hardy: So every day pretty much AI has come a really long way like the social media posts, you know, like stuff with LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, any like newspaper stuff that I'm just having it he wants me to do. And I go one to chat, and, you know, I just tell it what it needed. Tell me what to write for a caption and like a post and all that. It's awesome. It saves me a lot of time with that. And I'm actually looking at app again. I can see I can't connect my chat. So Rev is in a sense of like a firefly. So you can bring it to your meetings to record. I didn't know that. I just really use it to add, you know, I go to the little plus sign and I press, I can either upload a video or record. That's what I usually do. But I did not know it was like a fireflies and connect to my meetings. I might have to try that out.
Nick Delgado: How do you learn about different AI tools?
Victoria Hardy: So the girl who worked with Todd. She was actually who she's now let go, though, she was actually telling me all about chat, like chat and all that. And that was the software that she used, and she was training me on all that. And I should have done that a long time ago.
Nick Delgado: For a tool like Rev, how do you learn about all the features that could be helpful to you to use?
Victoria Hardy: Usually Todd always comes up with the most random like things for like AI. So then I have to learn their software and their tools and then turns out he doesn't want anymore. But usually he always comes up and then, you know, sometimes, too, I'll Google, you know, like, nice software for like attorneys and or estate planning or AI tools to help with like his specific type of legal practice. And I've come across a few of them, and some of them he sticks with. But like I said, like he's getting annoyed with fireflies because they never go to any of our meetings, even though like all of our settings are right. So I might just have to mention to him about this rev calendar and see if he wants to test that out.
Nick Delgado: What are your thoughts on using AI in your work going forward?
Victoria Hardy: Oh I plan on using it all the time. It definitely gives me more ideas of a sense of like like I said, like what captions to write. You know, because I'll tell it like, give me like a 30 day, like plan for like captions and stuff like that. And it's just very makes your life a lot easier, for sure. Because you don't have to sit there and come up with something like all the time, and then like you can go on like Instagram or Facebook and like schedule it so you don't have to like worry about like missing a post or anything like that.
Nick Delgado: Rev is really interested in how they can strengthen their offering to better serve the legal industry. What could Rev do to better serve and appeal to firms like yours?
Victoria Hardy: Really am not quite sure about that question. I think that it's amazing itself. Like I said, I'm gonna have to talk to my boss because I really didn't know that you can bring that to meetings to record and transcribe. So I'm gonna have to talk to him today, because I actually have a meeting with him at 12:30. And I'm about to bring that up.
Nick Delgado: So you really appreciate the meeting invitation feature?
Victoria Hardy: Because he is getting very frustrated with fireflies. And that's important to have you know, Casey has to go back and like listen to something for you know, it was something he spoke with about a client that he didn't write down or, you know, so I know he counts on fireflies to record his meeting and like, you know, highlight the key points and like tasks and stuff like that. So I know that's important to him to have like a transcription to his all of his meetings and fireflies. I don't know why, but they never like, I have to like go manually put it in every single time, which is frustrating.
Nick Delgado: If you were the CEO of Rev, what would you change to better serve a company like yours?
Victoria Hardy: I mean, I really need to go more into like research of the app. I just really kind of go onto like help it like record for me. I definitely can get back with you about that question. You appeal to more to like law firms and such like that. Like I said I mainly use it for like me personally to help myself send him the transcriptions to like help save my time. But like I said I'll definitely get back to you about that question.
Nick Delgado: Is there anything else that you'd like to share about your experience with Rev that we didn't cover?
Victoria Hardy: No, I just really appreciate. And the app itself, it's definitely saved me a lot of stress. So it's a great app, I love it.
