I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","Sure.

I was like, is it though? And I remember him telling me now, I did not look into it, and I don't know what it was called, but I remember him telling me that it was like a subscription and that he was paying like 150 bucks a month for it. And I remember that being something to me that I was like, well, I don't want I don't know how often I'll use it because, you know, as a DA, I would have paid $150 a month, hands down, because I was getting ready for trials all the time. And you also need it just to just get a plea, you know what I mean? Like, sometimes you don't need the transcripts to. I mean, you just need the transcripts to know if you've got a strong enough case to even be worth trying. But on this side, it's not the same. Do you know what I mean?

If I were to say if it could be more streamlined, then it would be more on the medical side, just in terms of trying to organize all those records and get them in in a way that's easy to go through, which is, I mean, what we use in our legal practice. But, I can't think of anything legal wise. I mean, maybe that would be something for firms that do sort of mass tort stuff that have just reams and reams of documents, organizing that sort of like discovery process. That would certainly be helpful.

I think I deleted the ones that I already had to make because I no longer needed it anymore, but see it now actually and just transcribed it to, let's see if I can pull up. Yeah, I guess it won't let me know more. I deleted the ones that I don't need anymore, but basically a summary and then the key points and it helps when I send it to him.

So if there was a button on Zoom, just like you have record button, if there was a plugin, you can install a rev button that gives you the ability to run a transcript, that would be helpful.
