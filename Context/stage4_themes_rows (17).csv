So, if I could maybe set up categories, or maybe tell the summary to look out for these four issue areas. Or however many there may be for a specific attorney's preference. If I could teach it, you know, when you're doing me... When you're writing me the summary. ""Tell me about the person's prior accidents or prior injuries, history, whatever was said. Tell me about medical treatment. Like, look for keywords of doctor this, doctor that. And summarize medical treatment."" Like, I don't know if that's too specific? Or if I can put in keywords. Search for the keywords accident, then highlight everything that the guy said with the word ""accident"". Although, accident might be too general. But let's say I go through the guy's medical records and there is Dr. Smith. And then I would just put in a prompt saying, ""Highlight everything about Dr. Smith that's being said."" Or point it out in the summary. Let's say Dr. Smith performed a surgery that I'm arguing was not necessary. And plaintiff's attorney says it's absolutely necessary. And we might be going back and forth several times over what Dr. Smith did or didn't do. So, kind of, instead of me downloading the transcript and then control F and trying to figure it out.
