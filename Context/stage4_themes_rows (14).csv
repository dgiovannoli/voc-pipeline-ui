And he had a massage parlor out of his 29 commercial tenants. And he took it upon himself to challenge that citation as the landlord. And that was a one hour recorded zoom meeting.

I didn't want Speaker 1 to be identified. Speaker 2. I just wanted to what the hell are they talking about? And it did the trick. So that was my very first use case. I was not going to use that transcript in any hearing. I simply wanted to read it to see what happened during that one hour hearing. And then I gave it to my client saying, read this.
