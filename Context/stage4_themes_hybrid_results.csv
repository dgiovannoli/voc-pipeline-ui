And you also need it just to just get a plea, you know what I mean? Like, sometimes you don't need the transcripts to. I mean, you just need the transcripts to know if you've got a strong enough case to even be worth trying. But on this side, it's not the same. Do you know what I mean? Like like I don't I don't need it that often. And so I was like, I don't know as a new firm that I can justify. And I know $150 a month. That's not that huge of expense. But I was like, I'm trying to keep my overhead low, and I'm already paying for subscriptions for like a gazillion other things that I pay for. And I was like, I just don't know that I want another subscription because, like, what if I use it, like, twice? You know what I mean? Like, in six months?","No. But software packages? No. Give me like an like what would. In some cases the transcript could be integrated into a workflow, like into another software for additional processing or part of a broader workflow in general. So like a Clio type, one of those like, yeah, I understand what you're saying. No, I don't, I am pretty old school and I, you know, I have my Adobe Acrobat, which is like the most powerful piece of software I have. And. No, so I kind of I keep it basic. I've looked into those services, but it's like another monthly fee like another vendor. It's like that's that's one thing I will say. I, you know, I don't know what like revenue models Rev is considering or has or whatever, but I try to limit my subscriptions because I find even if you can cancel anytime. You know, it's like six months goes by and like, how much was I paying a month? And I think I never like. So I try to stay away from anything with a subscription unless I unless like Acrobat like which I could not do without. So no, I've kind of avoided those. Like all in one we do the billing.

They took a ton of stuff, and after they execute a search warrant, they give you a property receipt. This is everything we took from your house and it's been a year. They haven't filed charges.

I tried to file it in a civil with a civil clerk's office. They rejected it, and they said we cannot initiate a case based on emotion. Unless there's an asset forfeiture proceeding by the government, we cannot initiate a case. There was no asset forfeiture. There's no nothing. There's no case. So I was at my wit's end with this thing, and I talked to colleagues. I posted on CAALA about it. Nobody knew I could not figure it out. I went to ChatGPT and I described the very specific with more specifics that I'm telling you, and it said, you need to go to the criminal clerk, and the criminal clerk can initiate do case initiation under a miscellaneous setting. And I called the criminal clerk's office in that county and said, hey, this is what I'm trying to do. And the guy said, yeah, that's exactly how to do it. And I asked ChatGPT, where, where did you get that from? Like where the local rule of court or where is that? And it couldn't tell me where it got it from, but it had the 100% correct thing to do.

So I would say since I didn't even know that they use AI now and that that brings down the cost, I would maybe promote that a little bit more or make it more obvious on the website just to know to allow people to have that option more visible. But yeah, other than adding some integrations, I think that would be the biggest thing for me is just connecting it to things so that it's not sort of a standalone, it would be more involved. I mean, if you connected with something like RingCentral where there was a button or something that when you're downloading the call, you could just send it to Rev, have it integrated with RingCentral to automatically make that transcription for you through Rev.

I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area so we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners like me or very, very small firms. And so that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. So they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers so much time.

Because if it were with the given, with the current accuracy, I'd have a hard time justifying a greater cost because of how much work I've had to do.

Ben Evenstad: Well, like that example I gave when it identified the different speakers where it's not, you know, clear who's speaking. It's not let's say a you know, I'm just imagining this, but if there was like a, you know, let's say you wanted, you had a recording of a phone call where it was, you know, Jen and David and then it'd be pretty easy to say Jen said this, David said that, blah blah, blah. But again, the situations I'm talking about where it's like multiple parties, some things are kind of muffled or some person over here says something, but the video is not on them, so you don't know, but you could put it together like a minute later.

And so it's just a drop in the bucket for them to pay $30 for a login or whatever it is, or to pay for the transcriptions themselves, the certified ones.","F62, F61",Company A,,,,,,,,,2025-07-16T01:17:09.004158,2025-07-16T01:17:09.004158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful. And then do the same thing with those concepts. any mention of guns, R and d ones an overall take of all the files, rather it just be file by file.","I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things.

Delays in transcription services impact competitive positioning and highlight the importance of timely service delivery.,COMPETITIVE VULNERABILITY,"Won: 2, Lost: 0",,"Definitely the turnaround time and the availability and the accuracy. Those are probably the three most important because you are just, you're trying to put in, it's easier, like I said, to see the words instead of replaying it over and over again. And so you want to make sure that what they said is what they said word for word, because sometimes that could make or break a case.","I think it would definitely be useful if we had more cases that were specific to needing those because a lot of depositions and stuff are already being accounted for, but we don't do a lot of interviews and stuff just at our office. I actually was in school to do transcription and I timed out, so I wasn't able to do it and I had 0.5% left. So that was unfortunate. But it is definitely nice to have an option like Rev to take care of that transcript, especially when you're busy and you don't have time. I mean, a lot of times it takes two to three weeks maybe, and that's the soonest with any other transcription.","F50, F51",Company B,,,,,,,,,2025-07-16T01:17:09.251441,2025-07-16T01:17:09.251441,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right. they probably get more bang for their buck that way. Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good.
