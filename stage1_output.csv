Evenstad Law_Ben Evenstad_1_1,"I had a criminal case where there was a lot of body worn video. And I needed a transcription. And there was, like, I forget how long it was, but it was like, at least 30 minutes and different people talking. So I asked my wife, who works at a mid-size, she's also an attorney, works at a mid-sized defense firm. And they defend public entities, school districts, some local governments, and also big box stores. And their practice is very litigation intensive. So I asked my wife, I said, you know, I can sit here for three hours transcribing a 30 minute video. I'm like, what do you guys do? Do you have a person? Do you have a service? And this is I'd have to go back and look. But this is at least 3 or 4 years ago, maybe even longer. And she's like, oh, we use this company called Rev. It's just like online. So my understanding of the company at that time was that it was like a person doing it somewhere in the world. And so I uploaded the video and paid whatever it was and got it back in, like, like, no, like couple hours, I think. Or maybe the next day. And it was not perfect, but it was very good. And most importantly, to save me time, it identified Officer one. Officer two and it caught the name of the this person that was speaking and that person that was speaking. So it said, like this person said this. And then officer two said that and blah, blah, blah. And so I was like, wow, that's like crazy. And it worked out really well in that case. And to be honest, I didn't have occasion to use it for a long while. And then I more recently used it also for police body worn video. And I think it was AI this time that was doing it or automated that was doing it. So that's kind of my experience with Rev is just those two times.",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,Prompted evaluation of transcription services like Rev,closed_won,Evenstad Law,Ben Evenstad,2024-01-01
Evenstad Law_Ben Evenstad_1_2,"So I had earlier in my career, I had transcribed videos myself, and I'm a very fast typer. But the issue with transcribing is you still need to deposit every, you know, 10s to catch up or whatever. And if you need to put like an ellipses in there or whatever you need to do, it's like just I really it just takes so much time, and I was willing. I mean, don't tell them this, but I was willing to pay anything to, like, not have to sit there and do that. So to get like, a reliable transcript of a piece of video for a fairly nominal cost. It was like such a huge help. And I've talked to older attorneys where they would have to have their like, you know, support staff do it, or I think there used to be like court reporter services that could also do transcriptions from different videos. And I don't know what they paid back then, but I know what court reporters still cost today, and it's insane. So I don't know if this answers the question, but just to have that transcription like ability and quick. And the cost is in the right zone. That's like. Yeah, that's why I love the service.",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,Expectations for how the service would support you,closed_won,Evenstad Law,Ben Evenstad,2024-01-01
Evenstad Law_Ben Evenstad_1_3,"So, you know, accuracy is, you know, that's what you want. So I don't know if you're familiar with this, but when a video is shown, let's say, in front of a jury at trial, let's say, you provide the jury with a transcript of what's in the video, and the judge instructs the jury that the transcription is not evidence. Do not read what's on the page as evidence, only take into evidence what you are hearing and what you are seeing in the video. But the transcription is like an aid. Like kind of follow along and in my experience, it's been like kind of 1 or 2 page like short transcripts, but I've heard of trials where they're going to watch a 45 minute video and they read the transcript. And to be honest, the save in and again, I'm a small, you know, one man show. I don't know if a mid-size or larger firm wouldn't care as much about this, but, you know, I don't have, you know, besides my paralegal, I don't have a support staff. So my time is kind of the most valuable thing. If the transcription can be accurate and not require me to, like, go back over it and fill in a ton of stuff. Then it's just saving me time. And that's like, that's the game changer for me. It's like it has to. I want to think of as little as possible about a transcript. I just want to have the finished product.",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,Criteria for evaluation of transcription services,closed_won,Evenstad Law,Ben Evenstad,2024-01-01
NACE Law Group_Betty Behrens_1_1,"Right now we use it for transcription of taped conversations with either our experts. I've used it calls with witnesses, just rather than take notes, record it, and then have Rev transcribe it for our files. We use it for, we had a client who had taken some voice notes during a meeting with a doctor at a hospital. And we transcribed those. So that's primarily what I'm using Rev for.",Transcription Usage,For what work do you use it right now?,closed_won,NACE Law Group,Betty Behrens,2024-01-01
NACE Law Group_Betty Behrens_1_2,"We would save it to we have case management software that we use, we use Neos as our case management system. And we'll add it to the memos file in there. It's all digital. We move it around, we might attach it to an email to somebody and say, hey, here are the notes from conversation with Doctor Jones. He reviewed our case and that sort of thing. I, I don't I'm sure I would I haven't had the chance to do it yet, but it would certainly be helpful when drafting expert reports that are case filings to go back to those notes, maybe copy and paste some of the wording in my report to help with the outline of a report. Yeah.",Transcription Workflow,"When you get the transcription back, what do you do with it?",closed_won,NACE Law Group,Betty Behrens,2024-01-01
NACE Law Group_Betty Behrens_1_3,"Sure. So I primarily work with medical malpractice and personal injury cases. And specifically in medical malpractice cases, we have to find an expert in the same field of medicine as the doctor that we're suing. To say that there was negligence and violations of standards of care. That's the number one thing we have to do to prove our case. So generally and these are medical heavy stuff. I know some stuff about medicine, not a lot. So we tend to record conversations with these physicians that review the cases for us, review the records and say, oh, Doctor Jones missed this on the x ray and this is what happened and what he should have done, etc., etc.. And then later in the case we have to file with the court a report saying this is what our expert is going to say at trial. And they have to be pretty thorough. And so what I would expect that I would do, if I had a transcription from one of those calls with our expert, I would go back to that in order to draft that report and maybe copy and paste some stuff from that transcription into the report, that sort of thing.",Medical Malpractice Case Workflow,Can you help me understand that use case and if there's anything Rev could do to make that easier?,closed_won,NACE Law Group,Betty Behrens,2024-01-01
Luminos Law_Christina Fouche_1_1,"So my name is Christina Fouch√©. I'm the director of operations for a law firm that handles AI compliance. This one, we are looking at 7 to 8 attorneys and four support staff, but we just recently got bought out by a mid-size firm, so we are going to be absorbed into a medium sized firm that has 80 attorneys and I think it was 35 support staff. That is slowly already kind of taking place. They bought us out. As of, we signed the contract at the end of December 31st, and now we are absorbed to that new firm. So when that new firm, I am the operations manager for the AI division. And now we're just completely absorbed. So when I use Rev, it was for our AI and managing different meetings, just trying to get different testimonies of how they've been using the program and what they are looking for. A lot of people were sending different meetings. It was before really when Zoom and teams meetings were actually transcribing and transcribing the meetings, we were using Rev a lot for those type. So now with more companies doing it, we haven't had to use Rev as much.",Company Acquisition and Transition to New Firm,Introduction and Firm Size,closed_won,Luminos Law,Christina Fouche,2024-01-01
Luminos Law_Christina Fouche_1_2,"That very few in between. And I'm trying to remember when did we use it for the legal ones. When we had pretty much recordings or audios in conference room, like in person type one, we would tell them we would record it. Those recordings I used to send in to Rev when I wanted to transcribe it, just so we can have a record. So if someone wanted to reference something, they didn't have to listen to the two hour meeting, they can go into the highlights of Rev transcription to find and listen to it. That was really helpful when we were doing in person that I would use you guys, because I've used you guys in the last 3 or 4 firms that we've used. In the mass tort when I used to work for this company, I told them that a lot of the calls that we would get would be recorded, and that they should try using your service to just have it transcribed. So we just had a transcript of the call in the file, just for better reference and for auditing.",Usage of Rev for Legal Recordings and Transcriptions,Legal Use Cases for Rev Transcriptions,closed_won,Luminos Law,Christina Fouche,2024-01-01
Luminos Law_Christina Fouche_1_3,"In the legal world when you have mass torts and you have so many people, so many claimants and you have to call each one, go through the questions to see what they qualified. Those type of transcripts are a lot easier than going back to the calls. And if you're familiar with, like the Johnson and Johnson Talcum Powder Mass tort, or if you've seen, like the Camp Lejeune commercials, you can have a thousand plus potential claimants that you have to have calls that you're just calling them. But we have the audio, but we don't have the transcripts. And then when you go through all their documents and it comes, the other side would pick out a few potential claimants that they want to do further depositions on. You want to go back to those calls again. You don't want to listen to it. So going when it qualifies to the second round using your service was a very big help in just having that file and preparing the attorneys so they don't have to listen to the call. They can just read what the call had, and if they had any questions, they were ready for depositions. So if you really want to know the space now that would be probably give you the best client base. I would look into the mass tort space.",Benefits of Rev Transcriptions in Mass Tort Litigation,Impact of Rev Transcriptions in Mass Tort Cases,closed_won,Luminos Law,Christina Fouche,2024-01-01
