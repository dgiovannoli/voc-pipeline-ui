Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_1,"I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. So it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. So it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. So if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,What prompted the interviewee to evaluate Rev and how has it helped in their legal practice?,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_2,"Yeah, so I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? So look around, do you mind? Things like that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. So certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, so punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing. Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. So it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. So sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area so we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners like me or very, very small firms. And so that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. So they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers so much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,Can you provide specific use cases and scenarios where Rev's AI feature has been beneficial in your legal practice?,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_3,"I think that equally, I mean, I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. Right. So they probably get more bang for their buck that way.",Strategic Perspectives,How does the interviewee view the value of Rev in different types of legal cases and the potential for AI to enhance legal research?,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
