Nick Codispoti (00:00:38 - 00:00:39)
Adri, nice to meet you.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:40 - 00:00:43)
Hey, Nick, nice to meet you as well. Thanks for taking time. Of course.
Nick Codispoti (00:00:44 - 00:00:45)
How can I help?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:47 - 00:01:16)
I conduct research. My agency does market research on customers and prospects, and Shipbob is a longtime customer of mine and they hire us to learn how to better serve their customers and earn the business of new prospects. And so, with your permission, we have a 25 minute conversation about just your goals, your experiences in fulfillment, what you're looking for, needed, and in opinions of Shipub and I share with them privately so they can improve what they're doing.
Nick Codispoti (00:01:17 - 00:01:19)
Okay, Perfect. Happy to do that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:20 - 00:01:30)
Is it okay with you if you record this conversation? Yeah. Awesome. Let me just make sure I have my metadata right. You're at Metro Vein centers, is that correct?
Nick Codispoti (00:01:30 - 00:01:31)
Yep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:32 - 00:01:33)
And you're in operations there, correct?
Nick Codispoti (00:01:33 - 00:01:34)
Yep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:35 - 00:01:39)
And did you. What I don't have here is do you evaluate Shipbob recently?
Nick Codispoti (00:01:41 - 00:01:48)
Did I evaluate? Yes. I was the one trying to figure out if there was a solution there. Yeah. For a certain thing that we had. Yep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:48 - 00:01:51)
Great. And did you decide not to go with Ship Up? Correct.
Nick Codispoti (00:01:51 - 00:01:52)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:52 - 00:02:00)
Okay, cool. That's all I need to get started. So what triggered a. An evaluation of three PL providers, including Shipbob, recently?
Nick Codispoti (00:02:01 - 00:02:44)
We. So we have 60 clinics nationwide and we basically send new patients a package, if you will. Right now it's primarily more print shop related, but there was a question to see if we wanted to add more. It's called product with it, like we take care of veins. So right now it's like a brochure and a letter and an appointment card, but maybe we wanted to add like a compression stocking or something. So I'm a longtime friend of Anthony Watson, one of the founders, and so he put me in touch based on their volume, that, you know, maybe ship hop could be a solution here. Great time.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:45 - 00:02:53)
And what were your evaluation criteria for deciding whether I guess A3PL would work for you at all? And then specifically.
Nick Codispoti (00:02:53 - 00:03:17)
Yeah, right now our current staff is like, you know, their side job or labor. We spent labor hours like packaging this all up. And we had a print shop, obviously design and print. So I was just. This is the first time I was looking to see, to kind of get this out of house and automate it. And so that was the initial sort of request and evaluation.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:19 - 00:03:35)
Within that you had that need and pain point. It's currently people's kind of side job. As you started to look at them, did you say, hey, we will go in this direction if it meets certain speed or a certain cost or a Certain quality.
Nick Codispoti (00:03:35 - 00:04:15)
Yeah. I evaluated the cost that was costing me, like in house of how many FTEs and then also like the collateral. So that was initially going to be the. The price. Price point was going to be. I would think so. First off, point one, I was thinking, because I can automate it, it would be cheaper. Point two is if I got this task off the team, it would be a big win. They don't want to do it. And then three, just like scalability as we add 20, 30 more clinics instead of sort of training other people to do it or not. This is completely out of their. Their scope. So there was three reasons why I engaged there.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:17 - 00:04:20)
Did you evaluate any other providers besides Shabab?
Nick Codispoti (00:04:20 - 00:04:40)
Yeah, we ended up going to two to three more providers, but I think shipbob was primarily like three pl. We've now more entered into the print shop. So it's kind of like a different line of business. I don't think I continued with Ship Bob's conversation because they weren't HIPAA compliant.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:41 - 00:04:52)
Okay. Outside of the HIPAA compliance, how did you find the Shipop offering in your. In your sales conversations?
Nick Codispoti (00:04:53 - 00:05:16)
Yeah, I thought it was fair. I thought they were very creative in how they could. A little bit out of their scope or out of, you know, it would have been more of a unique client experience. So there, I think, I don't know, systems engineer, whoever came on the call, the sales was just overall very good experience. Just wasn't the right fit.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:17 - 00:05:26)
Got it. And you referenced HIPAA compliance that because your. Why is that? Why is that needed for your.
Nick Codispoti (00:05:26 - 00:06:00)
It's like, yeah, private personal data that was going to flow through and in the medical community. Needed to, you know, we need to secure that with. I don't know exactly. I'm not so green on it, but there's an agreement between us and the vendor. How does the data pipeline to the vendor? What is the vendor doing to, you know, make sure that the privacy remains? So that's all HIPAA stuff. And I think, you know, shipbob doesn't enter into the HIPAA world. At least they don't have initial clients in the medical world with that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:01 - 00:06:13)
Got it. I'm gonna ask a couple questions that hope they don't feel redundant, but I just want to get kind of more specific answers on them.
Nick Codispoti (00:06:15 - 00:06:16)
The.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:19 - 00:06:31)
This is exactly what we're talking to. But were there any specific needs to your industry you had to consider? I'm hearing HIPAA compliance and privacy. Is that true? And then is there anything else that comes to mind for your industry?
Nick Codispoti (00:06:31 - 00:07:31)
Specific for industry specific. I wouldn't say industry specific. I think that, you know, that was what I just mentioned was the industry specific response in terms of like practicality of our ask what was wrong with, not what was wrong with it. Why we want we moved from a 3 PL to a print shop evaluated. Right. So instead of adding the compression stockings, we continued with this print shop brochures and stuff. And so no longer was it a, you know, you have version one on the shelf and you pick it up and you ship it out. It was more of like a blank piece of paper and everything's printed on there. So Shipo was giving us a solution where they essentially just offload the current tasks off our team and now we've come up with a solution with a print shot that's more scalable because it's the uniqueness of the packages getting printed versus you're sorting everything.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:32 - 00:07:47)
Yeah, that makes sense. I think that to me just the lack of HIP compliance would mean that if I was to ask you how suited to ship up your industry, 0 to 10 it be 0 just because it doesn't have the required security requirement.
Nick Codispoti (00:07:48 - 00:07:51)
Yeah, I think that's fair. Binary.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:52 - 00:08:04)
Tell me if you don't mind how the world of the print shop works. So you, you get a new client, you send them an address and send them like is everybody get the same thing or they, they product.
Nick Codispoti (00:08:04 - 00:09:38)
Yeah, so I'll just kind of go. So the current state of affairs is we have 50, 60 clinics, 35 physicians, obviously unique patient books, a new appointment. They have an appointment date and time as well. So what's happening is they get a letter specific to that clinic slash doctor, they get a written out appointment card, they get a brochure packed in and that's kind of the original package, if you will. And each of those letters are unique to each clinic or each doctor. And then obviously the appointment card of 5, 8, you know, 5pm on certain date is unique. And so now and then also the envelopes were had the same return address as the clinic. So now you have a unique envelope. So now what we're doing is we're going to do a double window envelope, print the address on the back of the piece of paper. We're going to do if you've seen like these kind of like pull, you know, those credit cards, those debit cards that kind of pull off if you will, on like a piece of paper. If you got like mail from like a loan agency or something, they have like, or like a fake, you know, discover, you know, yeah, like a fake kind of. We're going to utilize that as an appointment card. We can just print on that. So now we're just printing on blank pieces of paper. And so when they get the data of Dr. A drew 9am they print directly. You know, the software is now just generating the. What's going to be on the print. But you're, you have a consistent envelope, white envelope, white piece of paper, appointment card.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:40 - 00:09:50)
And are there print shops that specialize in this sort of constant flow of kind of. It's almost like drop shipping labels.
Nick Codispoti (00:09:50 - 00:10:13)
Yeah, there's, there's many. We actually end up with, we're ending up with a handwritten one. So they're using robots to. So these letters are actually going to look handwritten. We're paying a little bit more for that. But there, that's how they print. Yeah. The vendor you went with, you want the name?
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:13 - 00:10:15)
Yeah, I'd love to go learn about it.
Nick Codispoti (00:10:22 - 00:10:43)
Let me see, let me follow up with that. My marketing team took over this project. But let me, let me see here. Wait, I got it. I think it's called Handley Written.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:43 - 00:10:49)
Honestly, is that and is that also the print shop like. Or is that a separate.
Nick Codispoti (00:10:49 - 00:10:51)
They're gonna act like the print shop.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:51 - 00:10:52)
Yeah, got it.
Nick Codispoti (00:10:53 - 00:10:58)
There's other print shops that I engage that we're going to do handwritten there. I'm just going to use print shops.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:58 - 00:11:16)
Yeah. Awesome. Can we talk about your sales experience with Ship up just to see if there's something that they can learn from that. Obviously I know it's the HIPAA compliance and the shift to the print model, but in, in hearing from them, anything that they did well or you think they can improve upon.
Nick Codispoti (00:11:17 - 00:12:10)
No, I just think they met me where I was at. Where. Which is like a warm introduction from the founder. Didn't oversell me, just came more as informative. You know, I, I'm in like sales in the medical world and I just prefer like sort of that information that knowledge is really the most powerful sale. And so they had that approach. I really have no kind of critique or feedback from them. I thought they, you know, did sort of follow ups and organization of follow ups. Well brought in the solutions engineer at the appropriate time, were succinct on if they could do it or not. And when we came to a point where we just knew we were in a fit, you know, they were, they were good. They were the ones not pushing more. It was like, okay, we tried. We, we're not the fit right now. Great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:10 - 00:12:14)
Did they reference any Similar clients or is it truly unique for them?
Nick Codispoti (00:12:17 - 00:12:49)
I wouldn't say. I couldn't remember a name. I don't think they referenced a specific client, but I thought they were. I didn't know how they would do it because they. I knew 3 PL but they, you know, they reviewed with me many times of how they could sort of pre or pre receive, make these things unique and then potentially like write appointment cards. So I thought their solutions were creative. Even though like they didn't just give up the moment they heard anything, they continued to follow up and try to be creative. So that's where I'm like, you know, I was, I was impressed by that, that process.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:50 - 00:12:56)
Awesome. Did you get to the point of pricing or did you stop? You figured out there wasn't a right then?
Nick Codispoti (00:12:56 - 00:13:10)
No, I think they, I don't think they gave me pricing because it was like, hey, can you do the HIPPA compliance? If not, if so, let's do the. Let's, let's go pricing. I don't remember the pricing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:10 - 00:13:11)
Yeah, that's okay.
Nick Codispoti (00:13:11 - 00:13:12)
Came in.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:16 - 00:13:24)
If you were to expand your shipping at some point to include physical goods, would you consider shipbob again?
Nick Codispoti (00:13:24 - 00:13:31)
We'd have to. Yeah. Because now we're dealing not with a print shop. We. We're dealing with just packaging.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:31 - 00:13:38)
Sure. But in the sense of like you had a positive enough interaction then that they would be a vendor who you'd consider for that.
Nick Codispoti (00:13:39 - 00:13:40)
Definitely, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:41 - 00:13:55)
Okay, great. I mean pretty black and white scenario. Not too deep to dive into, but is there anything else that I to find a question, anything else I just haven't asked about that I think you think would be worth sharing for them to improve?
Nick Codispoti (00:13:56 - 00:14:06)
No, I just think overall it was a square peg in a round hole. We tried. They were professional and I was impressed by them and it was just not the fit at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:07 - 00:14:09)
Okay, well, Nick, thank you for your time.
Nick Codispoti (00:14:09 - 00:14:09)
Cool.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:10 - 00:14:15)
I appreciate you Have a great day. And your Compensation will within 24 hours send it over email.
Nick Codispoti (00:14:15 - 00:14:18)
Oh, thank you. I appreciate it. Bye bye.

Rob Capodici (00:00:02 - 00:00:03)
Hey, Drew, can you hear me okay?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:04 - 00:00:05)
I can hear you now.
Rob Capodici (00:00:05 - 00:00:06)
Perfect. Sorry about that. How you doing?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:06 - 00:00:09)
I'm doing well. Nice to meet you. My name is Drew Giovanoli.
Rob Capodici (00:00:10 - 00:00:15)
Nice to meet you. I am Rob Capodici. I've been at Taos for about like 11 years now.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:16 - 00:00:25)
Amazing. Yeah, I was just on your site checking out sandals and they look. They look awesome. I have not heard of it before, but that's. I need to get into the game.
Rob Capodici (00:00:26 - 00:00:29)
Yeah, we're growing, thankfully, so that's a blessing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:29 - 00:01:00)
Yeah, that's great. Well, let me give you context. I've been a long time partner Shipbob's, and my job is to simply talk to people who evaluated them and learn how they can better serve their customers and earn the business new prospects. I am not with Shipbob. I'm a completely independent kind of third party and unbiased. I try to sell you. I just try to learn so I can pass back information. And with your permission, we'll Talk for about 25 minutes and I'll do record it and share it back to them. With your permission.
Rob Capodici (00:01:01 - 00:01:02)
No problem. That's okay. Sure.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:02 - 00:01:03)
Awesome.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:04 - 00:01:17)
Well, let's just get started for context. I want to make sure I have all the details right. You did evaluate Shipbob fairly recently, but decided not to go forward with them as a 3 PL solution, correct?
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:18 - 00:01:19)
Yes. Okay, great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:19 - 00:01:23)
And can you tell me a little bit more about your role at Taos Footwear?
Rob Capodici (00:01:23 - 00:02:08)
So I've been, you know, on paper now, I guess you can say I'm the E commerce manager, but realistically speaking, I've been the E commerce manager for like 11 years. Even at the ground floor, it was just me and another individual and we sort of split all the. We. We split the workloads. I built a customer service platform, or standards rather, and the department, I still manage them. Now I manage our offshore dev team as well. And then at the same time, I report to my supervisor with analytics, product reviews, customer reviews, where on the website we might be vulnerable or weak, where we could get better at. And. And then I also oversee a couple areas of our three PLs.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:09 - 00:02:09)
Awesome.
Rob Capodici (00:02:10 - 00:02:13)
Essentially, I've been doing that for. For the last decade or so.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:13 - 00:02:13)
Awesome.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:14 - 00:02:18)
And can you give me context on kind of the size and scale of Taos?
Rob Capodici (00:02:19 - 00:03:03)
Yeah, so like we did about 320,000 orders last year. Last month we had a foot trap, digital foot traffic of about maybe a million. And. And so, you know, we're definitely growing in great ways, but there are areas where we want to be able to definitely improve. And one of those areas are, you know, our fulfillment. It's not that I, it's not that we didn't sign with shipbob immediately. It's more so we are. It's like Los Angeles real estate. You might be happy where you're at, but it's always going to behoove you to see what else is out there. And that's sort of the position as of right now.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:03 - 00:03:03)
Awesome.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:04 - 00:03:24)
Well, let's start from the beginning. Which is what, what triggered you to just start evaluating new vendors or different solution? It sounds like you gave the LA real estate example, but was there anything going on? Was it kind of just pricing pressure, desire to improve scalability, anything at all that or just a regular cadence of evaluation?
Rob Capodici (00:03:24 - 00:04:34)
Well, it's definitely the regular cadence for sure. But at the same time, it's, you know, we're not in this business to downgrade. We're looking to expand and to keep growing year over year. And fulfillment wise, that's a big deal because with our demographic, our goal is to be sensitive to their needs and have a great delivered deliverability rate and fulfillment rate, but also a great rate with, or a great reputation with keeping track of our product. What do we have at any given hour of any given day at the same time, keep those fulfillments going. So it's, it's a, it's an equal balance of those things. And, and we, you know, warehousing is tough, logistics is tough, operations can be tough, especially when you're just striving to get better and better. So the pressure is always on. But you know, pressure, you know, it's going to make a pipe or it's going to, you know, bust a pipe or it's going to make a diamond. Right. So it's like, you know, that pressure is never going to go away. So, you know, you really just have to learn and just get smarter year over year.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:35 - 00:04:36)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:36 - 00:04:39)
What's your current solution for warehousing fulfillment?
Rob Capodici (00:04:40 - 00:04:53)
We have our own native, we have our own native warehouse, but we do, we also, I should have mentioned, we also do wholesale. So it's, it's a, it's a lot of pressure on our current warehouse.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:53 - 00:04:59)
And does your current warehouse use any sort of warehouse management software on that's outside of your own?
Rob Capodici (00:04:59 - 00:05:01)
Yeah, I think they use, they use scale.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:02 - 00:05:02)
Scale.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:02 - 00:05:03)
Got it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:04 - 00:05:14)
Well, as you look at other vendors, what criteria come to mind as things that are important to you to evaluate a good, good vendor?
Rob Capodici (00:05:16 - 00:06:15)
Off the bat, of course, the pricing and the terms and conditions, such as shrinkage, the way they handle the product, the way they count inventory, the way they receive our inventory, whether it be from our warehouse or from the factories overseas. Moreover, fast fulfillment is, is a key. We have to keep up with those that are bigger and better than us. And so aside from, you know, fulfillment and deliverability, I think maybe the digital operations is the last thing, you know, just to have. Well, I guess that goes in terms with support. So like any kind of support and digital operations, you know, the, the portal and the. And the software has to be navigationally friendly. And, you know, I'm not a big fan of glitches and bugs and downtime, especially in this day and age. So those are definitely heavily weighed.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:16 - 00:06:17)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:17 - 00:06:39)
If you don't mind, I'm going to launch a little poll survey. You'll see right in your screen. It has to do with pillars and priority. And these are not your rating of shipbob. Just simply how important are these items to you as you evaluate three PLs? And you could just click into it and Iron trust.
Rob Capodici (00:06:50 - 00:06:52)
Yeah, I mean, they're all a high priority, right?
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:53 - 00:06:53)
Sure.
Rob Capodici (00:06:55 - 00:07:28)
Yeah. I mean, these are, you know, they're all high priority. They're definitely things that you don't want to skimp on. You know, you want to give them the proper amount of recognition and evaluation and consideration. But yeah, they're all definitely high priority. And that's just something I think every brand is, is striving to achieve and then once they get closer, actually achieve it. There's like this new bar or this new standard of, you know, what do we do next and how do we do it better than we already have.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:28 - 00:07:29)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:32 - 00:07:40)
How important was it to you to find someone with kind of industry experience in your industry? When you're looking at 3pls.
Rob Capodici (00:07:41 - 00:10:03)
When you say industry experience, do you. How deep do you mean in terms of like e commerce? You know, for example, we are women's footwear and with, you know, wellness and beauty is exploding. Apparel is exploding. Footwear is, is definitely exploding. Has been. But at the same time, with footwear, you have colors and sizes. So that means you have a broad array of variants and that you. I could argue, we could argue all day that it's the same as apparel and I can argue that it's not. But there are similarities. But the differences are such shipping a women's T shirt in a poly bag, you know, via usps, is, you know, a little below our standards and practices of shipping a 14 by 10 by 6 pair of women shoes that were handmade in in Spain and high quality leather, they can't be in a poly bag. They're going to take up more space on a plane, more space on a, on a vehicle. And so the dimensions and the pricing will be, will be higher. And then at the same time with our price point, we want to have the proper, the proper, the proper company like shipping, the proper carrier shipping our product. You know, there's, there's brand, there's three PLs out there that are using a lot of different carriers and, and you know, for example, it's, it's a little weird in, even in this day and age where, you know, you ship a pair of women's shoes and the person delivering it is doordash. It's, you know, on the surface it's confusing, but it's like, hey, this is the cheapest rate and we got it there fast and yada, yada, yada. And I get that, I understand that and that's fantastic. So there's a couple of mental hurdles, I guess you could say that are interesting. But nevertheless, yeah, I think just being able to ship a product in a certain manner to where, hey, we have standards and we have brand following that we want to sort of maintain.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:04 - 00:10:14)
Yeah, well, how was suited from 0 to 10, if 10 is perfectly suited. Do you think Ship Bob was to handle women's shoes and at the level you wanted to?
Rob Capodici (00:10:15 - 00:10:19)
I think it's, I think they're definitely able. They're. Because they're global, right?
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:19 - 00:10:20)
Yep.
Rob Capodici (00:10:20 - 00:11:10)
Yeah, from what I read and the research I did. And the gentleman I spoke with, his name was Cole. Very, very articulate, very informative, very attentive and responsive when we talked, it was a good meeting. It was nothing against Cole, it was nothing against Ship Bob. It was just more so of our current position at the time and it's sort of similar right now. We're still, we're move at a turtle pace. We, we like to measure twice and cut once. But I certainly think Ship Bob has an amazing reputation. I think they can definitely do the job. It's just, you know, it's finding the right fit, you know, no pun intended. It's just like footwear. You got to find the right fit. I could sell you on, on, you know, Nikes or the, on brand or whatever kind of trainers that I wear, but they might not work for you and your feet, you know, so it's, it's definitely a fit thing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:12 - 00:11:15)
Did you evaluate any other vendors that seemed like a good fit for you.
Rob Capodici (00:11:15 - 00:11:17)
In your industry, say one more time?
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:17 - 00:11:21)
Did you Evaluate any other. Like, what other vendors did you evaluate that you thought might be a good.
Rob Capodici (00:11:21 - 00:12:03)
Fit, not a full blown evaluation? I did go to the Deliver event in Las Vegas last October and that gave me a better understanding of who's doing what in the fulfillment arena. But nobody sort of spoke. No, I, I feel like Ship Bob was ship up, sort of just trumped everybody else. And let's just say nobody really comes to mind that I kept a business card for. Yeah, they sort of fell short. And, and that's sort of the feeling I, I walked away with. And we haven't really been evaluating wholeheartedly lately.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:04 - 00:12:11)
You spoke to maybe it was the state that your business was in to not be the right position to move or not.
Rob Capodici (00:12:12 - 00:12:12)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:13 - 00:12:18)
Can you just. You mind describing to me with more detail, like why that was? What do you mean by that?
Rob Capodici (00:12:19 - 00:13:22)
Yeah, we. So we're. We're not a big company manpower wise, so there's a lot of things that we are currently owning on our plate right now. And we're inching our way towards, you know, seeing who will be able to do this job, who we want to do this job. And as we get freer from, you know, just the constant bondage of responsibility, we're. We're inching our way towards, you know, who we need someone to do a job. But we have to find the right. We have to find the right company because again, we're small and operationally it's just too important to not sort of screw this up. And again, this has nothing to do with shipbob. This is just our mentality. We, like I said, we like to make decisions slowly. We like to, you know, when I say do research, it's a molasses kind of face.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:24 - 00:13:41)
The. What would change in your business or what state would you have to reach to make a decision? And you could. It could be ship out, could be anybody, but kind of what do you think that. What does that hurdle look like that you overcome or say, cool, the business is now ready we are at. No matter what the speed is.
Rob Capodici (00:13:42 - 00:15:30)
Well, you know, we're definitely ready, but we want to find a partner who will not have any problem fulfilling on the weekends, will not have any problem fulfilling during Black Friday Cyber Monday. They have at least 3, 4, 5 fulfillment locations across the country. We do a lot of business in the upper Northwest as well as Southern California, as well as the Southeast or. Yeah, southwestern part of the country, but east of the Mississippi, Florida, and, and, and the, you know, Pennsylvania, New York. We do a lot of business in that realm in those areas too. So it's more so just being able. How do we reach our customers in a cost efficient manner and not have it be an inventory headache on our end, you know, have proper reporting, analytics and metrics and, and, and also maintain a fulfillment speed and a deliverability rate without having to sort of, you know, again lose out on. Oh well, you know, we see downtime on Black Friday, Cyber Monday or you know, our warehouses, they don't work on, on, on Sundays or I mean on Saturdays. So there's just sort of like these different kinds of, of tidbits that we're trying to piece together to really, really make the fulfillment of the operations, you know, efficient. And keyword there is efficiency. Because nowadays, like everything is just, everybody's just throwing money at you, they're trying to pay you off, they're trying to buy you. And we don't need that, with all due respect. We need efficiency and we need a good partner. And I think that's what really speaks volumes to good businesses, is money's great, but where's the trust in the partnership?
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:31 - 00:15:31)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:34 - 00:16:01)
Now, excuse my directness. I'm just going to try to figure out things I don't fully understand. What I heard was that it's actually you guys are ready, but there's a level of like trust. You need to find an efficiency in the partner's ability to achieve your goals. And a lot of that has to do with being able to have the right warehouses around the country and deliver right up times at key moments of the year. Is that a correct statement?
Rob Capodici (00:16:01 - 00:16:02)
Yes.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:03 - 00:16:26)
Did you what about Chip Bob and the other vendors was missing from that equation that didn't earn your trust in order to say, hey, if our business is ready and we know the things we need and these businesses are trying to sell me clearly some things, there's a gap right between their pitch to you and what you believe. So what is that gap?
Rob Capodici (00:16:27 - 00:16:37)
Well, one company, for example, they said that they would have a heavy downtime during Black Friday Cyber Monday. Another company only had three fulfillment locations across the country.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:37 - 00:16:39)
How about ship up in particular?
Rob Capodici (00:16:41 - 00:17:31)
I want to learn more about ship, Bob, which is actually the one of the reasons I took this call. I've left. You know, it sounds sort of embarrassing actually, now that I think about out loud, but I left Cole's email unread because I knew, I knew I was going to go back to it with more questions. But when it comes to the trust factor, you know, I left his email unread because I didn't Find, you know, any kind of distrust in the salesmanship. And then for, you know, the other people, there was a lack in salesmanship. It was, you know, they just. They just didn't do it. And, you know, the care wasn't there, and the answers sort of weren't correct or right or in line with our beliefs. So I sort of moved on. But at the end of the day, Shipbob is a horse that I want to learn more about.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:32 - 00:17:33)
Okay, got it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:33 - 00:17:46)
Yeah. And so maybe it was more a timing thing. Like, your business is ready, but you've got a bunch of priorities that you're dealing with. It sounds like you've been there 11 years. You got a lot on your plate. Is that right? That maybe it had to hit the right timing for you of when you wanted to solve that problem?
Rob Capodici (00:17:47 - 00:18:12)
Yeah, it's that. And it's also, you know, this is going to be a future kind of partnership. And so, you know, it's not like we would sign any dotted lines, you know, this summer, it's. It's more so, okay, you know, what kind of a. What. How much can we evaluate to really. To really embed, hey, this is the way to go. Okay. Let's move forward with this company.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:13 - 00:18:13)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:14 - 00:18:25)
And just so I make sure I'm clear, it sounds like decisions move slow. You've been building this great business. The business is ready.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:25 - 00:18:26)
It's.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:26 - 00:18:39)
It's not going to happen this summer. I'm totally unbiased, but just kind of understand the timelines, like, what would have to happen for you to feel confident in ship up or anybody to say, hey, now is the right time, whether it's this fall or 2026, you know, is that.
Rob Capodici (00:18:39 - 00:19:17)
Does that count? Yeah. Like, in terms of that, when we do decide on the company, the ball will be in our court to understand. Okay. What's the operational time frame? Because again, we are small, we are busy, and this is not an easy lift. You know, it's not. Once we had the company. Okay, we need to plan out what. What's the best way to do it? Do we ship from our warehouse? Do we ship from the factory? In three different countries? And then how's that going to look when it's coming from X, Y and Z countries, things of that nature.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:17 - 00:19:26)
Okay, great. And just so I make sure I capture it, would you. Just because you brought it up, are you okay with Cole reaches back out?
Rob Capodici (00:19:27 - 00:19:37)
Yeah, of course. I mean, I'm going to reach. I'm going to reach out to Cole, but in. In due time. That's Sort of why I, you know, put it on the digital shelf.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:37 - 00:19:38)
That's right.
Rob Capodici (00:19:38 - 00:19:40)
Because. Yeah, that's just how it is.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:40 - 00:19:41)
Cool.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:41 - 00:19:53)
Let's talk about Ship. Bob, the. In that first call, or you. The calls that you have with Cole, are there any kind of weaknesses or concerns you have that you kind of want to look more into?
Rob Capodici (00:19:54 - 00:21:12)
Yeah, I want to better understand, you know, the Black Friday Cyber Monday, the. What the contract would be like, what the shrinkage rate would be like, how they handle the inventory, how they handle outgoing inventory to customers, and then how they handle, you know, how they count and handle inventory that we send to them. We. If there's. And then, you know, metrics in terms of, like, reporting and analytics. You know, we have. We have a team that exports, you know, reports and. And want to be able to better understand those reports, and we use SAP Business one. That's our erp and which I think Cole actually confirmed that shipbob does integrate with. So having visibility into any given SKU at any given time, that's a big. That's a big thing for us because our. My. My bosses, they look at these reports because at the end of the day, that's cash. It doesn't matter if it's two pairs of shoes or if it's 12,000 pairs of shoes. So, you know, there's. There's reporting and. And any kind of shipping restrictions, whether it be weekends, what are the cutoff times, where the hubs located, do they handle any apparel brand, do they do return logistics, things of that nature.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:13 - 00:21:13)
Got it.
Rob Capodici (00:21:13 - 00:21:14)
Yeah. It's a lot.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:15 - 00:21:15)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:16 - 00:21:22)
What stood out to you as the things they did? Well, like why. Why did they. Why did they deserve a callback when the others don't?
Rob Capodici (00:21:24 - 00:21:54)
The way he positioned himself on the. On the call, the way he positions Ship up and, you know, I like the fact that they're global, which is something in my mind, and it has to be in everybody's mind is, you know, at what point do we really consider, you know, how do we take the brand worldwide and how do we logistically make that happen for, like, returns and duties and taxes, things of that nature? Which is a whole other conversation. We have it a whole other different year.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:54 - 00:21:54)
But.
Rob Capodici (00:21:56 - 00:22:25)
No, it was just. It was a great first impression, and it was a professional first impression, and he had good answers, and he provided me with a lot of literature. He provided with a lot of PDFs, and again, which is why I left it on read, because nobody really compared to his salesmanship. I guess I could just be brutally Honest and say, yeah, sure.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:27 - 00:22:34)
If you. Somebody asks you about Ship up and you have to describe it with just, you know, two or three words. Based on your conversation with Cole, how would you describe them?
Rob Capodici (00:22:40 - 00:22:44)
A worldwide shipping company? I would just keep it simple, to be honest.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:44 - 00:22:44)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:45 - 00:22:46)
Awesome.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:47 - 00:22:53)
When you think about the pricing process, did you get into any. Any details around price?
Rob Capodici (00:22:53 - 00:22:55)
I don't recall that we did.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:55 - 00:23:10)
Okay, no problem. One of my favorite questions is, Rob, you were the CEO of Shipbob. What would you do to better serve a company like Taos?
Rob Capodici (00:23:13 - 00:23:15)
Be careful who's working in your warehouses.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:16 - 00:23:22)
Okay. What is the. What have you seen out there? What does that kind of allude to?
Rob Capodici (00:23:22 - 00:24:29)
There's warehouse people and there's suits. And when I say suits, not. Not in this day and age, definitely not in California. Not people who actually wear suits in the office, but executives, people who are counting the beans, who are wanting to know where every dollar is at. And then you have warehouse people who respectfully, you. You don't know the caliber of person. You don't know if they really care about their job. You don't know. You know, they're not thinking about, especially with companies that are dealing with multiple brands. You know, people in the warehouse, they're not really thinking about me and my bottom line and my team shipping a pair of women's shoes and all that. They're just sort of, you know, they show up, they do their job and they want to provide for their family, God bless them. Rightfully so. But not everybody is there to sort of do their job diligently. So I think when you're running a company, you have to. You have to be aware of the temperature of those who are in the trenches.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:30 - 00:24:41)
Sure. Is there anything we haven't talked about when it comes to 3pls or shipbob that you maybe expected me to ask about or that you have on your mind to share?
Rob Capodici (00:24:43 - 00:24:45)
If you were running Shipbob, what would you do?
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:49 - 00:25:47)
I've been working with them for maybe 16, 17 months interviewing customers. And I think the thing that they. The thing that I've advised them to do, that they've been leaning into lately, is to think and talk to customers at a very vertical and use case specific way, one that feels like a really relevant. To make sure they're talking in a really relevant stories when they talk to you. It's not just about shipping logistics. It's about how to ship not just apparel, but the other shoe brands. They have, you know, they've got such depth of a client base that they can afford to talk, be really explicit in how they handle each of those problems. But it's harder to do, right. To like make sure you have those examples put together and speak it that speak that language. But that was kind of. It's been one of my top kind of feedbacks and I think they're doing a better job at it over the past year.
Rob Capodici (00:25:48 - 00:25:57)
Who, who would you say is a, A competitor that gives them a run for their money?
Drew Giovannoli (00:26:00 - 00:26:26)
It's. It's hard to say because they. There's so many different stages of business that I talk to. I talk to people who are just coming out of the garage to massive, massive players who have like multiple warehouse 3pls and global. And so I don't, I don't necessarily want to like mention other competitors, but I will say that they.
Rob Capodici (00:26:28 - 00:26:30)
Well, it's like, it's like the Hertz Avis thing, right?
Drew Giovannoli (00:26:31 - 00:26:32)
Yeah, totally.
Rob Capodici (00:26:32 - 00:26:35)
There's always a number one. Number two, there's always Pepsi, there's always Coke.
Drew Giovannoli (00:26:35 - 00:26:36)
Yeah.
Rob Capodici (00:26:36 - 00:26:48)
But I, I totally understand your rationalization there. I mean, you know, I'm not asking you to, to listen, you know, list competitors for me to go out. No, not at all. I'm just curious because it's such a competitive industry.
Drew Giovannoli (00:26:48 - 00:26:49)
Yeah.
Rob Capodici (00:26:49 - 00:27:22)
And to be brutally honest, it's. It's an industry that I am glad that I don't have to work in because I see the headaches that can come about when things are not going smoothly. And I don't know if it's old school Sicilian, I don't know if I'm ocd. I don't know what it is. I'm sure I'll figure it out when I'm like 60. But I need things to. I love when things run like a well oiled machine. I love efficiency and any hiccups, any speed bumps, sort of like they drive me nuts. Especially when it's unnecessary inefficiency.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:23 - 00:27:27)
I mean, my family's from Abruzzo, which is kind of central.
Rob Capodici (00:27:27 - 00:27:28)
Okay, nice.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:28 - 00:27:57)
Yeah. You know, you mentioned kind of look at the 3 PL industry. I've just, I didn't know much about what it took to get a product out the door before I started working with ship up. You know, just, I have been so impressed by the brands and how like how much effort and time and just money they have to put into not getting a great product, getting it to the customer and how much margin that eats up.
Rob Capodici (00:27:57 - 00:27:58)
Oh yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:58 - 00:28:21)
Returns, shipping, speed. And then they've got to compete with like these behemoths of Amazon and Walmart. And there is Warehouse, too. But yeah, I'm always just, I enjoy. I have a bunch of clients. But this is, these are some of my favorite interviews. Cause these are kind of real people. They tend to really care about their, the brands they work for. And it's. I think it's a tough job, and you guys do it pretty well.
Rob Capodici (00:28:22 - 00:28:24)
Agreed. Well said.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:24 - 00:28:27)
Well, Rob, it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for your time today.
Rob Capodici (00:28:27 - 00:28:38)
Of course. So what's the next steps with the recording? Do you, do you lob it up to Shipbob and they sort of, you know, do it, do more salesmanship on their end and things of that nature.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:38 - 00:29:28)
So I tend, we tend to pull together these learnings and blocks. And so this is kind of the early end of a block where we'll pull together 20 to 30 interviews and say, here are the themes we're learning, that we're learning about. Here's what you're doing. Well, you should double down on. Here's some process or product things that we think there's areas for improvement that you could kind of win new customers or that could really delight people who are evaluating you as a 3 PL. And so I'm happy to send a note to the team internally about anything you'd like, but kind of the standard process is unless something's kind of explicit like, hey, Rob wants to talk, or Rob's got this big problem, it gets just consolidated alongside 20 to 30 other interviews to pull together a report for their team to say, hey, how do you improve?
Rob Capodici (00:29:29 - 00:30:07)
Yeah, very smart. I like that. Yeah. Information is power. Right? It's not, you know, it's. I, I feel like, I don't know if somebody, I think it was like Tony Robbins or somebody said it, like, we're no longer in the information age. We're in the entertainment age, where everybody just wants to be entertained. But I think that's a generational thing. Like, I still love information because there's just so much value there. The, the younger generations, they can, they can have all the content, but information, yeah, information is where it's at. I, I, you don't have to say anything to Cole. I'm. Like I said, I left his contact and his email unread. There's some things that I want to discuss internally with my team.
Drew Giovannoli (00:30:07 - 00:30:08)
Yeah.
Rob Capodici (00:30:08 - 00:30:21)
And, you know, and we'll see what happens again. We're, we make decisions slowly, but, But I appreciated this chat. It means a lot, and I hope, I hope you, you found value in it as well.
Drew Giovannoli (00:30:21 - 00:30:27)
I appreciate that. I did and you'll get an email within 24 hours about how you'll receive your compensation. Kind of over email.
Rob Capodici (00:30:28 - 00:30:30)
Okay, fantastic. All right, well, you have a great rest of your day.
Drew Giovannoli (00:30:31 - 00:30:32)
You too, Rob. Bye.
Rob Capodici (00:30:32 - 00:30:32)
Bye.

Kroma Matt Lebo (00:04:44 - 00:04:44) Hello. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Hi, how are you? Matt Lebo (00:04:49 - 00:04:50) I'm doing all right. Matt Lebo (00:04:50 - 00:04:51) How are you? Matt Lebo (00:04:51 - 00:04:51) Good. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Thanks for making time. Appreciate it. For context, this is a interview for Ship Bob, private to them only. And their goal is to simply learn how they can improve. I'm a third party, so I have no bias in the matter. But I appreciate the chance to get to know you and learn more about your experiences. And with your permission, we'll record this. It'll be a 20 minute conversation and privately use only for ship up. And you'll get an email of compensation should within 24 hours banks around July 4th. I don't know exactly what's going to happen there. So may push into Monday of next week. Matt Lebo (00:05:28 - 00:05:29) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Does that all work for you? Matt Lebo (00:05:31 - 00:05:33) Yes. Okay, great. Matt Lebo (00:05:36 - 00:05:39) How widely circulated is this video? I don't know that I filmed 100%. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Only internally at Ship up. Matt Lebo (00:05:44 - 00:05:44) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** But it may be like it gets shared through the product or marketing, sales, any, anywhere they feel like it can be improved. The way it works is I take this. We have probably aggregate 30 interviews together to produce a report, but they will have access to the original kind of transcripts and videos. My goal is to put together themes from a bunch of conversations. Matt Lebo (00:06:04 - 00:06:04) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:06:06 - 00:06:09) Yeah. Great. Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I was just checking out Chroma Wellness. Would you mind kind of introducing yourself and your role kind of responsibilities there? Matt Lebo (00:06:16 - 00:06:16) Yep. Matt Lebo (00:06:16 - 00:06:22) My name is Matt Lebow, Director of Operations, deal with sourcing logistics. Matt Lebo (00:06:24 - 00:06:25) Awesome. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And did you recently evaluate and decide not to go with Shipop, is that correct? Matt Lebo (00:06:33 - 00:06:33) Right. Matt Lebo (00:06:33 - 00:06:34) Awesome. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** What prompted you to evaluate new solutions in the first place? Matt Lebo (00:06:42 - 00:06:52) It's the biggest challenge. We were having challenges around inventory. In addition, we thought that, you know, Bison was not the best. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Where were you before? Matt Lebo (00:06:57 - 00:06:59) I'd rather not say. Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And as you ran into those challenges, what criteria did you have as you began to evaluate other providers? Matt Lebo (00:07:13 - 00:07:30) I think it's, you know, pricing is a huge thing, but also, you know, we have a complex product so ability to, you know. Matt Lebo (00:07:32 - 00:07:33) You know. Matt Lebo (00:07:35 - 00:08:28) You know, complete the complex operations of the assembly and you know, a feeling of, you know, having good communication because there's just a lot of things that come up. And so, you know, knowing that there's someone to call and get a hold of software, I think that's something that we're dealing with, you know, that is currently not great in our existing solution. And so, you know, knowing that there's some, you know, usable wms that's going to, you know, simplify my role or at least not further complicated, I guess. Yeah. So I think you. But generally, you know, I Think boiling it down price customer service software. Matt Lebo (00:08:30 - 00:08:30) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I mean what I also heard is you, you've got food products and so I imagine like what I heard was that it matters to you that that person knows how to handle that complexity. Right. I was looking at the bone broth. Looked like there's all sorts of things in there from Matcha to cookie butter. I didn't go too deep yet, but like there's diverse food products that. That matter to you or was kind of. Matt Lebo (00:08:54 - 00:09:11) It's not, it's not about that. It's about the. We have a kit. There's an assembly for that kit. It's a complex assembly. It can't, you know, there's a number of components. If there's a team that's not versed in that, then things can get mixed up very quick. Right? Matt Lebo (00:09:11 - 00:09:12) Yep. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So it's more about the complexity of the kit than industry specific experience around food. Matt Lebo (00:09:17 - 00:09:18) Right. Cool. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I'm gonna launch something on your screen. Really simple. Just we try to get a little quantitative data answer like a brief survey, if you're okay with it and don't mind. It's just. It's not about ship, Bob. It's about. As you looked at vendors, how important were these things to you? Ship up or any other vendor you might have looked at. Awesome. Thank you so much. Mentioned the complexity and the price. How well suited from 0 to 10 was ship off at those things. Where did they. Matt Lebo (00:10:15 - 00:10:15) And then. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And where do they fall short? Matt Lebo (00:10:19 - 00:10:34) I would say they were fairly well suited to really all of the things we required. I don't know that it's anywhere they necessarily fell short. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:10:35 - 00:10:57) I think that a large driving factor of our decision was a personal relationship. Not mine, but someone else in the business with another three PL and the things with. The thing with three PLs is it's. It's a rough world. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:10:57 - 00:11:09) And so know, you know, having done business with, you know, if someone has done business with someone for years upon years and they feel very comfortable with them, it's very hard to overcome that. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:11:10 - 00:11:17) With you know, even though. Even though the calls I had were good. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:11:18 - 00:11:33) So I guess the thing is that person that came on was new. So when I started the conversations with ship up, that wasn't a factor. And then it became a factor. So I would say that's really the biggest driving force of why we didn't. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Now. Matt Lebo (00:11:35 - 00:11:36) I think. Matt Lebo (00:11:37 - 00:11:38) The. Matt Lebo (00:11:40 - 00:12:34) And I guess it was one of these things where it would be virtually impossible for me to sell ship Bob or anyone else into that situation. And and, but I guess if we wanted to take it one level further, let's say that relationship didn't exist, would we have gone with Ship Bob? I think they were in the running. I would say the things that I was not fully comfortable with it at, you know, at this point of my. At this point in the search was, you know, shipo's larger than. It's. It's larger than a lot of the other places we were looking at. Most of the other companies had three, four DCs. You know, ship Bob has a bit more than that. And I know that. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Or I. Matt Lebo (00:12:38 - 00:12:42) You know, my belief is that kind of. That complicates things. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:12:42 - 00:14:54) It's a lot to oversee. It's a lot to make sure that every team on the ground is sharp right there. It's. It's like fulfillment's not complicated, but it's also very complicated. And, you know, I've seen. Not from Ship Bob, but I've seen where it gets sloppy and how things kind of go sideways. And so I would say just the skate, you know, the scale of Ship Bob was almost so, you know, it was something that I wasn't fully 100 comfortable with. And I think the thing is, if I was selling soap and it's like, you know, there's four varieties of soap. Yeah. It doesn't. I'm not. It would be much less of a thing. But when you have 40. Well, call it 55 components that go into a single box. You can't ship a single box if all 55 of those are not there. They're not, you know, organized. You know, then you. There's just a lot more holes to fall through, I think, with. With that kind of reach. So that was, you know, that was my biggest thing, I think, you know, I. I would say, in terms of my general view of Ship Bob, if you would, you know, I would have not even had a conversation with them probably three or four years ago, because I think the reputation was that there was a lot of growth very quickly. It. And it was not fully digested. And, you know, there was that. The chaos of COVID Right. You know, D2C was going crazy and Shabbat was growing. And, you know, I think there was an industry vibe that, you know, if you were a small, medium brand, you were like you were going to fall through the cracks at something like Shipbob. You know, I think then I think that reputation has improved, but I still think it's, you know, there's probably some hurdle there. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** What did. What changed your mind? Or at least slightly improved it. Was it just talking to other people in charge of fulfillment? Was it an event newsletter? Like, how did they improve it? And you know, my goal is to figure out, yeah, how, how, and then how do they keep doing it? Matt Lebo (00:15:12 - 00:15:13) But what. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Any ideas changed it? Matt Lebo (00:15:18 - 00:15:24) I mean, I would say maybe some conversations, but it was, it was more conversations with the team. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:15:24 - 00:15:36) It was saying, okay, I'll hop on the phone, let's see what this is about. And then saying, okay, you know what, this actually seems like a decent team. And the more people I spoke with, you know, I gained some level of confidence. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So did any of the smaller companies that you looked at do something that gave you this increased sense of trust that they could handle 50 different elements going into a box? I think, Chip, I would be interested to learn, like, what about their process as a small company? Or is it just reputationally smaller company, smaller team, you can get kind of a different level of service. What about the smaller company gave you that? Was it something they did or just overall thoughts? Matt Lebo (00:16:10 - 00:16:19) No, I, I would say it's more my, I guess my existing experience. Matt Lebo (00:16:20 - 00:16:21) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:16:21 - 00:16:57) And that, you know, spreading out fulfillment and especially the assembly part across multiple DCs, I saw how that just get got, you know, incredibly not, I wouldn't say an order order of magnitude, but meaningfully more complex spreading out. And so it was, you know, I think there was almost just a feeling of simplicity. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:16:58 - 00:17:10) With some of those smaller things. And I think the other thing is some of the, you know, a lot, some of those smaller companies, you know, the founders or, you know, you know, people that started the business are still there. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:17:11 - 00:17:25) They're sitting in the office taking the calls with you, and you can. You, you just have a feeling that, like, if something goes sideways, which it will, like I can get one of these guys on the phone and, and, and figure it out. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, right. Matt Lebo (00:17:27 - 00:17:39) Whereas, you know, you get a feeling with a larger company that's like, it'll get figured out, but not, you know, it might. There might be a queue of things that need to happen first. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:17:40 - 00:17:40) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:17:40 - 00:18:00) And I believe, you know, I just, I guess I generally feel that with smaller companies there is kind of like a dynamic, more of a dynamic or, you know, quick response that can be had. Matt Lebo (00:18:00 - 00:18:01) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:18:01 - 00:18:02) Because of that. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, I understand that. Just for Ship, Bob's learning, if it got towards the end of the deal and you're kind of feeling that way and the founder, CEO Dhruv, or his co founder hopped on a call with you from shipbob, would that have helped overcome it, do you think? Or like. Matt Lebo (00:18:22 - 00:18:31) Well, yeah, I mean, we're delving into a bit of hypothetical at that. Because when we made our, when, when the decision was made, it was not because of what I'm. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:18:32 - 00:18:44) And so we're saying, well, like if we got to that point, would it have made a difference? You know, probably. Probably. Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:18:44 - 00:18:45) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:18:45 - 00:19:06) I, I think, I think that maybe not even getting on the phone with a co founder, but maybe just knowing that someone who could make things happen there was some sort of personal kind of touch. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right? Matt Lebo (00:19:07 - 00:19:08) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** And just for your kind, like the hypotheticals, just. So if there, if it comes up as a theme, right. That there are people trusting smaller companies because of that access, hearing what might work as solutions, giving them things to test could be useful. That's, you know, that's why I ask. Matt Lebo (00:19:26 - 00:19:41) Yeah, I think could be worth, worth a test, I think. You know, and I, I think. And the other thing is it may not matter as much to every business. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:19:45 - 00:19:50) You know, I think with ours in particular, there's just an element of chaos. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:19:51 - 00:20:01) Because of, you know, you've got a product that's a meaningful money in revenue that you can't ship if you don't have 55 things in the same place. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right? Matt Lebo (00:20:02 - 00:20:03) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:20:04 - 00:20:46) So there just needs to be like a really hands on kind of thing where it's like, you know, there's, there's just a lot, there's a lot of like inside baseball stuff where the, it's like, you know, oh, you know, you've got, here's, here's your, your 55 things and you've got X number of each one of these. Oh, but wait, did you get short like one of these boxes? Mislabeled and it's actually like a, the wrong color for that particular thing. And so you don't, you know, but you wouldn't know that unless you're, you've been working on that box for a long time or you, you know, you're the guy who's. I'm babbling a bit, but you know, I get it. Matt Lebo (00:20:47 - 00:20:48) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** It's a cool product. My wife and I on a more recent health kick and I think she would, she would love it. I'm really excited to try this out. You don't have to share names, you're not comfortable. But where did Shipbob stand out positively or negatively against the other vendors you explored and don't have to include kind of the person who came in and had a preference, but wherever you could share kind of their competitive differences, positive and negative. I appreciate it. Matt Lebo (00:21:27 - 00:21:30) I would say pricing was like, it was fair. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:21:30 - 00:21:45) It was mid, you know, it was better than what we currently have. And in terms of the, you know, the companies we were in looking at it was, you know, there's, there's a couple different things that go into pricing. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:21:45 - 00:21:49) You've got storage, pick and peg and assembly for us at least. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:21:49 - 00:22:05) So there's those three components. So you know, they were really good on in some aspects. They were middle of the road on some others. I, I would say that pricing was not, you know, something that deterred, that would have deterred us. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:22:14 - 00:22:17) Wms, I thought was, was pretty, pretty good. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Now were you looking at it for WMS because you're using a different, you're not doing warehousing yourself. Unless I cut that wrong. Matt Lebo (00:22:29 - 00:22:35) Correct. But I'm talking about the platform, the thing that we would be using. Like there's interactive software tool. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:22:35 - 00:22:53) Like where are my orders, what's my inventory? All that. I'm talking about that I thought it was, that was a good tool. And then I guess personal relationship was, you know, it was fine. But it did kind of change a few times. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:22:53 - 00:23:08) So like, and maybe this is because we were taking forever to do something and so it kind of just got passed down the road. But you know, I would say that's some, you know, the people I, I, everyone I spoke with was great. Matt Lebo (00:23:09 - 00:23:09) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:23:09 - 00:23:11) But it did kind of change a few times. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So. Matt Lebo (00:23:11 - 00:23:16) Sure that I think, you know. Matt Lebo (00:23:16 - 00:23:16) Yeah. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Is there anything that any of the other vendors did that was a impressive standout? So not necessarily a ship up weakness, but something you're like, oh, wow, that, that was stand out for me. Matt Lebo (00:23:34 - 00:23:34) You. Matt Lebo (00:23:34 - 00:23:50) Know, I think not really, to be honest with you. I mean, not really. Matt Lebo (00:23:50 - 00:23:50) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** You mentioned pricing. Something we're just trying to dig into a little bit. Is, did the, was there any. How easy or difficult was it to gather and provide the data needed for pricing? Like, what was that process? Like? It sounds like the pricing seemed fair, but was there anything negative, neutral or positive about that experience? Matt Lebo (00:24:10 - 00:24:25) No, I thought it was pretty straightforward, to be honest. You know, it's a, it's a pain because you got to pull a bunch of different information, but yeah, you kind of have to do that forever. You know, I did it, I've done it four times. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Right. Matt Lebo (00:24:26 - 00:24:34) So like it's just part of the process, you know. Yeah, it, I wouldn't say it was any worse than any, you know. Matt Lebo (00:24:35 - 00:24:35) Yeah. Matt Lebo (00:24:36 - 00:25:11) Any other process. And I would say that it's, it's probably gotten simpler right to do over the, over the years because you know, the information is a lot easier to, to gather. And so it's. I it. At one point in time it was almost like a, you know, you'd be pretty motivated to, to look around. I think that now it's, it's a lot easier to, to look around, have some conversations than it was in the past. Matt Lebo (00:25:11 - 00:25:12) Cool. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Just a couple more for you, just to confirm. It sounds like somebody came in, they had a preferred vendor. You did make a switch from somebody to somebody else or do you end up sticking with your current provider? Matt Lebo (00:25:27 - 00:25:30) There's some, I'll just say no comment. Matt Lebo (00:25:31 - 00:25:31) Okay. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** If you were in charge of SHIP up, how would you, what would be the top priorities you would do to better serve a company like, like yours, like Chroma Wellness? Matt Lebo (00:25:50 - 00:26:21) Well, I don't know that I would say just broader general in industry wise. I would probably try to, you know, let's just say I wanted to attack the CPG space. For instance. I would get some people out at some events and events where like the operations people are, you know, geo specifics. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** You give me, maybe some of you attend. Matt Lebo (00:26:24 - 00:27:53) So you know, I, we are, you know, a fairly lean team. So I, you know, my, I do a lot of sourcing of ingredients and that kind of stuff as well. But like IFT or supply side, you know, there's a lot of different ops professionals there get, you know, just going, you know, getting some cocktails with people and like, you know, but because I, you know, there is still, you know, as much as we talk about technology and all that stuff, there is something where, you know, you want to do business with people, you know, and that you trust, you know, you trust and you know, price can only be so much of a differentiator. And so I think that, you know, and, and, and I have, you know, my belief, I think I'm kind of past it. But I do believe there is a bit of a, a stigma with ship, Bob, you know, in amongst certain people. And so I think finding what, you know, making that personal relationship with people, you know, showing up to things, you know, once and then getting a, get, you know, getting some people to, you know, some notable people to, to work with you and then be able to kind of say, okay, well it worked for them like, you know. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** So how did you, you knew about ship, but how did you come to include them in evaluation in the first place given that reputation? Matt Lebo (00:28:06 - 00:28:29) Was it a. I think that they had reached out When I had started, you know, I was already, like, in the midst of the process, and I was like, you know, what's one more? You know, And I think that I probably, you know, wasn't that interested. And then I had a really good conversation, and so it was like, okay, let's. Let's at least see what they have to say. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Okay, last question. Which Chroma product would you most recommend? I think the broths are probably the most likely thing that we'd try. Matt Lebo (00:28:41 - 00:28:41) Any. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Any will be the one you should check. Matt Lebo (00:28:44 - 00:29:09) My wife and I should check out, let's say Matcha. Matcha or Broths are probably the two biggest sellers. The hydration does really well in the summer. The magnesium is. Is also a fairly steady, good product. Those are the four that I'm. I order for myself, you know, fairly regularly. Matt Lebo (00:29:09 - 00:29:11) Great. Thanks, man. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** I appreciate your time today. I hope you have a great long weekend. Matt Lebo (00:29:15 - 00:29:22) Yeah, you as well. And if you want to drop me an email, I'll get you a discount code or something. Matt Lebo (00:29:23 - 00:29:23) Thanks. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Yeah, I'd love that. I'll definitely check it out. And like I mentioned, you'll get compensated for this time. I don't know with the holiday, how the bank kind of pays out and stuff, but by Monday, you should have at least a note with some details. Matt Lebo (00:29:35 - 00:29:35) Okay. Matt Lebo (00:29:36 - 00:29:36) It works. 

**Drew Giovannoli:** Thanks, man. Matt Lebo (00:29:37 - 00:29:38) All right, take care. Matt Lebo (00:29:38 - 00:29:39) Bye.

Raw Transcript:


Drew Giovannoli (00:00:02 - 00:01:29)
The coolest part about my job, especially with ship up, is I get to meet the coolest products all day long. I get to go as unbiased conversations with EOS founders. It's the vet. I love this front range. I have other clients where it's not as fun. You know, you can imagine talking to a bunch of lawyers. Yeah, the same kind of energy. It doesn't have the same interest. I'm not trying products, but this morning, who did I talk to? Somebody who had just like a really cool packaged bone broth and matcha tea type of business. And then now I get to talk to you completely. Here's the context. I work with Shipbob for over a year now and third party, unbiased interviews of people who have evaluated their software and chosen to buy or not buy. And the goal is to help them improve the way they serve their customers and earn new business. With your permission, we have a 20 minute conversation about 20, 25. It's recorded, but used only privately, internally for Shipbob to evaluate how they can improve. And we put together reports, 30 reports over a quarter that look at kind of what themes are emerging on where they're falling down and can improve and where they're doing well. Does that all sound good to you? And are you okay? Give us permission to record.
Brian Thomas (00:01:30 - 00:01:31)
Yes. Yes.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:31 - 00:01:40)
Awesome. Well, great. The context I have here is that you evaluated them fairly recently but chose not to move ahead. Is that all correct?
Brian Thomas (00:01:41 - 00:01:41)
Correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:41 - 00:01:45)
Awesome. And that you are the CEO of completing the puzzle.
Brian Thomas (00:01:46 - 00:01:47)
Correct. Great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:49 - 00:02:05)
Well then we're good to go. When you went to evaluate them, what was your current solution at the time with custom, as in you had your own warehouse, you were managing yourself, own.
Brian Thomas (00:02:05 - 00:02:09)
Warehouse, own software, own negotiated rates.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:10 - 00:02:15)
Great. And what prompted you to consider options outside of that?
Brian Thomas (00:02:18 - 00:03:18)
We're at the point where I either need to open up other warehouses or find someone that has a 3 PL network that I can like rent little spaces from to take advantage of like economies of scale shipping so we have enough volume where it start. It's making sense. It doesn't make sense for me to open up my own little warehouses, but it does make sense to rent little spaces cost efficient. And so it was like two parts that I was looking for was one was that. And the other thing was I spend a large majority of my time negotiating shipping rates and keeping the vendor relationships positive. It's a struggle. It's not actually something that I, I enjoy some of it and I enjoy the people, but it's also like it's a little Taxing sometimes. And I was.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:19 - 00:03:20)
It's not why you started the business.
Brian Thomas (00:03:20 - 00:03:36)
100 exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually, that's probably the more fair description of it. Like, I don't know, I get wind and dined to places. Like I went to a UFC event. Like, I don't know. It's like, what's. If you're a UFC fan, it's like, that's part of the canvas.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:36 - 00:03:37)
No way.
Brian Thomas (00:03:37 - 00:03:43)
Yeah. It's front row seat. One row one. It was cool.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:43 - 00:03:44)
That is cool.
Brian Thomas (00:03:44 - 00:03:46)
Who took you easy post?
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:47 - 00:03:48)
Very cool.
Brian Thomas (00:03:48 - 00:03:53)
Yeah. And so if you're a UFC fan, Uriah Faber set behind me. So that was like dope.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:54 - 00:03:56)
My goodness. That is awesome.
Brian Thomas (00:03:57 - 00:04:20)
Yeah, it was like that made my experience, but it also opened my eyes where it's like, there's a lot of money in this, so maybe if I can get someone that's not going to take me front row and give me a little bit better rates. Let's see. And yeah, so I was looking for someone to take all that off because as cool as that is, like, it's not really what I started it for.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:20 - 00:04:28)
Sure. And as you sort of look at new vendors, how did you source them and what was your evaluation criteria?
Brian Thomas (00:04:32 - 00:05:28)
How did I source them? Going to events. Events. Google Asking friends. So I'm in a mastermind with 24. There's 25 of us in this mastermind. I ask them, go to events like Sub Summit, Shop Talk and like Pack Expo. All the packing stuff. And then googling and just seeing like competitive analysis. Just like Ship Hero Verse. And then Ship Bob's gonna come up. Yeah, Ship here. Ship Easy Verse. And it'll pop up with Ship Bob or something like that. And I'm tangentially friends with like a C suite or a founder of Ship Bob. I forget who and who the friend is. But that was, I think that was. I think that person's in the mastermind. And that was the original, like intro.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:28 - 00:05:35)
Got it. And did you have a set of criteria going in? Like, these five things matter to me. Or was it more? Let me feel it out.
Brian Thomas (00:05:36 - 00:06:13)
Yeah, like the, the main thing was it was if you're going to charge a subscription fee and fees on top, do that. And don't charge me on rates or charge me on rates. I don't want. I don't want this double dipping because then I'm just going to. I'm going to feel taken advantage of and I just, I'd rather just have it be super transparent and I'd rather just get your Pass through rates and then you just charge me what you want to make. Just so I can feel like we're actually having a partner and relationship versus like me always second guessing, like, are they overcharging me? What's going on here?
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:13 - 00:06:14)
Yeah.
Brian Thomas (00:06:14 - 00:06:16)
Was number one.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:17 - 00:06:23)
Okay, so rates and the way they charge, not double dipping number one. What would be the other? Other few?
Brian Thomas (00:06:27 - 00:06:58)
I think that's, that's number one. And the rest came down to like, did I like them? Was it efficient? Like did they. Were they going to have as little errors as possible? So when I think about shipping, I think there, there are three legs. Price, speed, and quality for returns. I don't care about speed because I can always float the inventory. So I want it to be low price and high quality. And if it's super, super slow, great. Like that's like the ideal scenario.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:59 - 00:07:06)
Yeah. Let me launch. If you don't mind. We have a little like one survey question that we have right on the screen.
Brian Thomas (00:07:06 - 00:07:07)
Sure.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:07 - 00:07:19)
And it's about different pillars other people evaluate 3 PLs on. And so this is not your rating of shipbob. This is your evaluation of like how these things matter to you.
Brian Thomas (00:07:21 - 00:08:13)
Okay. What's interesting with two is I want it to be reliable and cost effective but I don't care about being price or. Never mind, I said that backwards. I want it to be reliable and cost effective but don't care about the speed because I think in my opinion number two is like the biggest thing with three pls and just any shipping vendor enable customizations at scale. I don't really care. Ours is like simple. There you go. That was fancy. I've never done a poll inside we.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:13 - 00:08:17)
It's our full time gig. We get, we get fancy with our surveys and questions.
Brian Thomas (00:08:18 - 00:08:18)
It is.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:21 - 00:08:57)
I need to ask you a questions about the. About shipping, but I want to ask you questions about the puzzle as a founder. So leave that. For the last couple minutes, it seems like you've got a fairly standard shipping package. Like you're not adding a bunch of. You're not kidding, a bunch of things together. I could be wrong. Were there specific like needs at a use case or industry that you were looking for? Like some people might say, hey, I need people who are pros at selling fragrances or food or they that matter to you.
Brian Thomas (00:08:58 - 00:08:58)
Nope.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:59 - 00:09:04)
Yep. If you don't mind sharing what vendors did you look at?
Brian Thomas (00:09:15 - 00:09:28)
Some I don't want to share the ones I will share Worldwide Express and then the rest are just kind of one offs to be honest.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:31 - 00:09:33)
Again, what do you mean by that.
Brian Thomas (00:09:34 - 00:09:57)
Like regional 3 PLs. So piecing together this like the puzzle of return shipping. So using different regional people to like someone to handle la, someone to handle Atlanta, someone to handle Chicago and then Pennsylvania ish area.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:58 - 00:10:03)
Did you end up choosing another vendor in the process?
Brian Thomas (00:10:04 - 00:10:41)
There's actually one, a competitor to Ship Bob that is gonna do. Honestly gonna do everything I wanted Ship Bob to do. They're passing through the rates. They're. We have like a per label markup and then we have a flat subscription fee and they're passing through the rates 100%. And they were actually like super transparent. They're like, these are the rates. And I was like, yeah, I know. Like, I can like, they, they sent me more than enough and I, I've now talked to enough vendors where I know that they're. They're not marking it up. So yeah, great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:43 - 00:11:02)
I would love to hear about comparative strengths and weaknesses of Ship Bob. Right. So across that vendor, what do you think the biggest gap that Ship Bob failed to meet your expectations or weaknesses or just reasons why you didn't go with them? We'll start there.
Brian Thomas (00:11:03 - 00:12:05)
Is honestly the people, because the. I've talked to Ship Bob two or three times now, and I kind of have the exact same conversation that I have with everyone where I'm like, don't upcharge me on the rates. Just charge me like your. I want to know what your margin is. Because I want to have a relationship and a partnership and that's what I view it is. And if you don't want to, that's fine, but if you want to, we can keep going down the road. And they're like, okay. And then Ship Bob is the slowest to get back to me. And at the end they end up marking up the rates and charging a subscription fee. And I'm like, you're just wasting my time. And it's just. It was frustrating. So it's just the people, like I say like, hey, don't, don't touch the red button. And then they're like, we won't. And then two months later they just like press the button and you're just like, oh, this is just disappointing from a humanity moral standpoint, to be honest.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:06 - 00:12:20)
We actually have a set of questions around the pricing experience, something we're looking into. And one of them is just like, how long did it take you to receive pricing from ship up long.
Brian Thomas (00:12:22 - 00:12:26)
They're like probably the longest.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:28 - 00:12:31)
Talking months, weeks, days.
Brian Thomas (00:12:33 - 00:12:44)
Yeah. April 23rd to July 11th. And just to get a no.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:46 - 00:12:56)
Now in in that time period, were there back and forth where you were providing them data or is that simply like they had what they needed April 23rd and they responded in July.
Brian Thomas (00:12:57 - 00:12:58)
Latter that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:59 - 00:13:01)
Yeah, it's not great.
Brian Thomas (00:13:01 - 00:14:24)
No, no. And so the whole. This most recent conversation started early February. So it took February until June 11th. Let's see the earliest. Oh, man. Yeah, I, I can't off the top of my head find or just in this moment find the first conversation, but the earliest email that I can see. Oh, January. Nope. Oh, it is January 8th. So we talked from January 8th. Gathered data, went back and forth until April 23rd. Yeah, April 23rd. And then from April 23rd I just sat waiting. And then June 11th I got a rejection that they weren't going to be able to do it a long time. That's six months. It's crazy.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:24 - 00:14:26)
How long did the competitors take?
Brian Thomas (00:14:28 - 00:14:49)
The longest one is they just actually sent it today. Three weeks. He just sent it today. So I will, I can pull it up. June 4th to July 3rd, that was the longest. So 29 days.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:49 - 00:14:52)
Okay. And then even faster than that.
Brian Thomas (00:14:53 - 00:15:30)
Correct. Yeah. The normal turnaround time is like two and a half, three weeks. The only land actually will give the people that just responded today a pass because in the middle of it there was a most recently rate increase. So it caused like some back and forth. They were, they communicated that. So the expectation was that like it didn't go the 29 days without communication like with Ship Bob with these guys, they preemptively reached out and said like, hey, as you know, industry changes and we're. It's taken a little longer. With Chipbot, it was just nothing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:33 - 00:15:40)
How about any experience from January to April? What was that experience like in terms of pricing and just sales?
Brian Thomas (00:15:45 - 00:16:21)
At the time it was fine and it was actually seemed really productive. And then at the end it just seemed misleading because it ended up being. It was disappointing in the end because it was overcharging on the rates, charges a subscription fee, which I asked not to do. And then when I pushed back, it was from whatever dates I told you, just silence. And then a rejection like, I don't know, it doesn't take that long to know that you don't want to do it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:22 - 00:16:33)
Was the. Just so I have clarity, was the April 23rd to July time frame a response to your pushback or a timeline to get the original pricing?
Brian Thomas (00:16:34 - 00:16:57)
No. So the, the original pricing came around in April. So it was April to June, not July. I think I misspoke. So it was April 23rd to June 11th. That time period was like, I pushed back on April 23rd, and then it was basically like that gap was them. I don't. I don't know. It was that. That was the gap for the rejection.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:58 - 00:17:07)
Excuse me pushing, but it's just something they want to learn about. And just how long did they kind of meet industry standard in terms of how long it took them to get to the original pricing? A few weeks.
Brian Thomas (00:17:09 - 00:17:14)
It wasn't the worst. Okay, yeah, Yeah. I would say the original thing was kind of fine.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:15 - 00:17:31)
If they had matched the pricing you needed right in the. In the format and the number, would they have had. Would they have won the deal? But they have not won the deal. And why, if pricing matched exactly like what you're going with today?
Brian Thomas (00:17:31 - 00:18:03)
Yep. I think out of the gate. So I had a bad experience, a very similar experience like two years ago with them. Let's say all that experience is down, and it's just like starting fresh with Chip Bob. It's called Bob 2. And it was the exact same software and everything probably. I mean, they were. Their. Their software and locations and everything else seemed awesome. It was just. It's honestly just people.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:05 - 00:18:17)
Yeah. And when you say people, I'm hearing, like, process to engage with and get pricing and concessions. Was it more than that? Was there a bad experience? Just one to one with the person on the phone also?
Brian Thomas (00:18:18 - 00:19:04)
Yeah, the first person. The I talked with the first person, like, organically, and then the next person I talked with at Sub Summit, and then this last person, they all said this exact same thing, which makes me feel like it's like a trained thing or learned when I push back on, why are you marking up the postage? They say, because we have to make money. All three of them said the exact same thing. And I was like, that's fine. But I started every conversation saying that I wanted you to be transparent with how much money you want to make. And they're just like, we're not telling you we have to make money. And it's just like it was the slimiest feeling.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:07 - 00:19:20)
All right, it sounds like there were positives as we want to move to that you mentioned, I believe, different locations and technology. But can you expand upon what you think they did? Well.
Brian Thomas (00:19:22 - 00:20:05)
I think their tech's pretty interesting, the way that they digitized the warehouse. They would spend time understanding our layout, giving us guidance on the layout. The API looked pretty dope, honestly. Like, probably one of the better APIs that I've seen. Like, from a tech perspective, I was pretty excited to integrate with Their software from a logistics perspective. I visited their warehouse in Dallas and it seemed pretty like, is a clean warehouse cleaner than this other one? I went today, and yeah, logistically and software wise, they seem to have it down.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:06 - 00:20:32)
Yeah. Cool. One of my favorite questions is to ask, if you were the CEO of Shipbob, what would you do to better serve companies like yours? And obviously I know the pricing. We kind of went to that in detail. So that aside, assume that's number one. Is there anything else that you would do to just better serve companies? Like completing the puzzle.
Brian Thomas (00:20:34 - 00:20:53)
Preemptively. Give, like, a timeline of, like, rough outline of, like, how long things should take. Because it was just a really long time without any notification and like, there was no expectation. Yeah, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:55 - 00:21:17)
Now we talked about Shipbob. Well. Or not well, is there anything that the other vendors did that kind of shine? Do you think, like, hey, Shipbob would benefit from hearing that this. The company did this part of the sales process or demo? Well, including or outside of the tickets to a. A cool UFC match?
Brian Thomas (00:21:18 - 00:23:04)
The. The tickets to the match, it was actually like, to me, it's actually a negative. Like, I'll do it all day long, but then I'm just like, oh, you're like, making more money. Like, a dinner is fine. Or like, honestly, the thing that does it for me is buying my employees, bringing coffee for the employees, coffee and donuts for the employees. I can do what I want. Like, I don't. If I wanted to go to the ufc, I could probably just pay for myself. Now it's cool if someone's paying for it, but what matters more to me is, like, the employees and them feeling like they get something. Yeah, the. The thing that the. The other vendors that I liked and the one that I'm going with, they were. They didn't waste time on the calls in a long, drawn out presentation. Like, I used to work for Booz Allen and it was like, very corporate, like, doing consulting, and we would do 20 page slideshows that were like, this is like, the benefits of working with Booz Allen and all this stuff. And I'm like, okay. Like, it doesn't really do much for me. And like, there was a lot of that with Shipbob, and I was just like, like, I get that shipbob's proud of Shipbob, but Shipbob didn't seem proud to work with me. And all the other vendors, like, literally had like one or no slides about themselves and then jumped immediately into me. And it just didn't waste time either. So I had a call with the one today and we spent. It was a 30 minute call. We spent the last 15 minutes like talking about our dogs because they just got right to it versus Ship Bob's the best.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:05 - 00:23:06)
Yeah.
Brian Thomas (00:23:06 - 00:23:07)
So yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:09 - 00:23:24)
Is there any topics that I did not ask about but you think Shipbob would value learning about? When you think about 3pls, you think about Ship Bob, it's like, oh yeah, we didn't talk about the demo or something like that.
Brian Thomas (00:23:28 - 00:23:32)
Not really. I think I could just going back to like the wasted stuff.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:32 - 00:23:33)
Yeah.
Brian Thomas (00:23:33 - 00:24:30)
Yeah. I'm barely fine asking for like demos and like seeing specific things, especially if I like know about it. Yeah. I don't necessarily think this is a Ship Bob thing, but I think in general, if someone is. I noticed this with one of the vendors. They didn't quite get that we do 100% round trip shipping. They spent a lot of time focusing on the outbound and the outbound we have down to a science at this point. And it was just like they kept talking about wanting to like take over my outbound. I was like, I'm on this call for returns and I think in general, just vendors understanding. Kind of going back to the whole thing. Like less about shipob, more about me. Like what? I mean, I'm selfish. I'm the one paying it. So I kind of want to just know, you know, what are you doing for me? Type of thing. And. And then we can joke around about dogs or something. But yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:30 - 00:24:52)
Awesome. Well, Brian, thank you for your time today. Yeah, it was great to meet you. It's a cool product too. Thanks. Check it out. I. I've got kids, they're 6 and 4. I feel like we do a lot of the same puzzles over and over again. So maybe this is a good. Obviously we're going to resonate with what you're doing here.
Brian Thomas (00:24:52 - 00:25:04)
Cool. Yeah, we. Man, I fell in love with this. This line from Cobble Hill. It's called a family puzzle.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:04 - 00:25:04)
Okay.
Brian Thomas (00:25:05 - 00:25:18)
On one side it starts with like really big pieces and then on the other side it goes down to normal sized pieces. So in the same puzzle, you can puzzle it with your kids. You can do the smaller pieces and they can do the bigger ones and you two like meet in the middle.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:19 - 00:25:20)
That's a great idea.
Brian Thomas (00:25:20 - 00:25:21)
Yeah, I love it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:22 - 00:25:28)
You could have different. You know, my son, who's younger could work on the biggest side. My daughter could work on the next phase.
Brian Thomas (00:25:28 - 00:25:29)
Exactly.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:30 - 00:25:35)
As part of your. Is that in the selection we do.
Brian Thomas (00:25:35 - 00:25:59)
They'Re not marked as Such though, you basically have to search for Cobble Hill. And then I think the front end, the, the marketing side that you're looking at is actually broken now. But in the back end we have like a custom app where you can go in and see like filter and like fine tune your favorites and everything.
Drew Giovannoli (00:26:00 - 00:26:12)
But yeah, as a puzzle expert, how do you feel about the puzzles that are meant to just torment you? Like, totally one color or like, no, more like.
Brian Thomas (00:26:13 - 00:27:13)
So it's weird that I'm running a puzzle company. I don't like really difficult puzzles. I don't do it for speed. I do it because, like, I honestly do it to connect to whoever I'm talking to. Yeah, it's a way to one do something together, but also like not pay attention to your phone. Like a lot of times, like meetings or whatever, someone will get distracted. And I find I'm more in tune and connected to the person sitting across from me when I'm doing a puzzle with them. So I'm like a 300 or a 500 piece puzzle person, bring them to meetings. So we have. And there's one of my PR people is keeps pushing me to do puzzle talk, which is like do interviews with someone else and video podcast style. And as we're talking, we're solving a puzzle together. Like hot ones, but for puzzles, exact 100%. And I'm like, I don't know, I'm busy.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:15 - 00:27:31)
Well, great to meet you. I appreciate your feedback. You'll get an email about compensation almost immediately. I don't know, it's July 4th. Like timing, like payments show up maybe Monday, Tuesday for that stuff. But thanks again. Nice meeting. Yeah.
Brian Thomas (00:27:31 - 00:27:32)
Yeah, that was nice meeting you too.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:33 - 00:27:34)
Have a good one. Bye.
Brian Thomas (00:27:34 - 00:27:35)
Take care. Have a good weekend.

Megan O'Leary (00:00:05 - 00:00:06)
Hi, Drew. How are you?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:06 - 00:00:08)
Good morning, Megan. I'm well, thank you.
Megan O'Leary (00:00:08 - 00:00:13)
Good. Sorry, I was running just a few minutes behind. Hopefully you got my email. I was just running a little bit late in a prior meeting.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:14 - 00:00:19)
It's okay. In the morning meetings, I think I appreciate a little delay.
Megan O'Leary (00:00:19 - 00:00:30)
Yeah, I get that when you Just a little bit in order to kind of get fully transitioned. And sometimes when you're going back to. Back to back, it's like, okay, I just need a minute. Like, let me catch my breath and change. Changed my mind over.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:31 - 00:00:32)
Totally. Are you on the east coast?
Megan O'Leary (00:00:33 - 00:00:40)
I am, yeah. I actually just moved to Alabama. I was based in Florida, down in Tampa, and then we moved up here to Alabama.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:40 - 00:00:55)
That's awesome. Yeah, I. I got home late last night from a. A trip, and I dropped the kids off at daycare, so I was rushing to get back anyway, and I. I was here. Espresso. I could take a deep breath, so I appreciate it. Yeah.
Megan O'Leary (00:00:57 - 00:01:01)
All right, cool. So what do we. What do y' all do want to go over and. Yes. How does this go?
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:01 - 00:01:27)
Yeah, this goes. Let me give you the. The brief, the speech that I have to give, which is Shipbob is trying to better serve their clients, earn the business new prospects. And so they have me, a third party, have conversations with people who've evaluated them. And so with your permission, for the next 20 to 25 minutes, we'll record a conversation only use internally for Shipbob. Does that work for you?
Megan O'Leary (00:01:27 - 00:01:28)
Yep, absolutely.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:28 - 00:01:56)
Cool. The casual version is we'll have a conversation about what you looked at, what you didn't, what you liked, things about the competitors. Feel free to answer whatever you're comfortable answering, but I'll guide you through it. And so the first part of this is just setting context. So I have some of your information here, but just so I have more depth than just the title of your role, can you tell me what. Tell me what your company and what your role is responsible for.
Megan O'Leary (00:01:56 - 00:02:41)
Yeah, absolutely. So I'm the vice president of commercial partnerships. I lead integration with bigger companies and kind of selling our capacity. I guess you could kind of look at it that way. So when we have partners that are coming across and wanting, like we sell all of our products through Shopify. We are Shopify app. We are a print on demand company. And so when we have companies that are interested and partnering with us, then I work with them directly versus the rest of us. We are currently in 27,000 Shopify stores, and they can sell our products on their own pages through their own Stores, that's kind of our merchant base. You can think of it that way. Versus I deal with like the bigger corporations when they want to come and sell our products in mass.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:42 - 00:02:48)
Awesome. And the notes I have here are that you did not choose to go ship up. Is that correct?
Megan O'Leary (00:02:48 - 00:02:48)
Correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:49 - 00:02:53)
Okay, great. But did you recently evaluate three PL vendors?
Megan O'Leary (00:02:53 - 00:02:54)
Yes.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:54 - 00:03:05)
Okay, perfect. Well, I got my context out of the way. The first question is what motivated you to evaluate new 3 PL vendors in the first place? And where were you coming from?
Megan O'Leary (00:03:05 - 00:04:01)
Yeah, so we've really grown our company over these past few years and the production part of our company has grown pretty dramatically. And so I started. But a big piece of our business is the pick pieces, things that don't need to be personalized, going to the end customer, being a pod company, things that, you know, our bread and butter, keep the lights on but don't need as handheld as going through the machines, being engraved, being printed on and and so forth. So what we were looking for was a partner that could take this pick part of the business. The more like easy part of the business for us so we could really focus in on our, our warehouse space and our capacity for the production and really growing that side of the business that's been taking off with our. The, the B2B side and is really a much more profitable piece of the business as well.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:01 - 00:04:04)
Yeah, of course. And you were managing your own warehouse?
Megan O'Leary (00:04:05 - 00:06:23)
We do, yeah. We have a warehouse. We have a 15,000 square foot warehouse down in Lutz, Florida. We just moved to it. Well, we're just moving to another one instead of. I'm sorry, I need to take this really quick. Okay. Sorry about that, Drew.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:23 - 00:06:24)
Improv and all.
Megan O'Leary (00:06:26 - 00:06:29)
Okay. So sorry, can you repeat the question? I can make sure I answer it for you.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:30 - 00:06:39)
Yeah, we were, I think I asked what triggered you to start looking for 3pls and I think you were talking about growth within the non on demand.
Megan O'Leary (00:06:40 - 00:06:45)
Product, non personalized product of the business. Yeah. So that's what we were looking to outsource.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:45 - 00:06:54)
Great. And how did you go about finding vendors and what was your short list after that?
Megan O'Leary (00:06:55 - 00:08:04)
Yeah, so we have looked at three PL companies for a while for different reasons around the company over the past few years. So I've interviewed quite a few. And so from that as I set up more in person interviews to understand the cost, the scope, understand who might be a good fit for what we were looking for. That's how I talked to a couple different companies and went through the interview process. But I would say it wasn't necessarily like a one time interview. I've done it multiple times over the past few years. So I was kind of able to figure out who I want to go with. I went with to interview Shipbot because of their. How expansive they are and they have a lot of warehouse points in a lot of key areas. So the time to get to the customer would be short and being able to support eventually multiple warehouses. But we are really looking to start with one warehouse. And the reason for that was because of inventory control. Being able to make sure we had the inventory position in the correct places. Minimize the complexities around inventory purchases and making sure things are sent to the right locations.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:05 - 00:08:11)
Sure. What was your evaluation criteria as you decided? Should we go with three PL?
Megan O'Leary (00:08:12 - 00:09:26)
I had like 26 different questions, maybe more than that that I asked each 3 PL company. But some, some of them were obviously pricing was a massive driver needed to see if it was going to make financial sense for us. Being able to use our own shipping accounts was a huge perk by being able to continue to grow our own shipping accounts. Otherwise if we were to take that piece off of our shipping accounts it can dramatically change our shipping rates that we're getting for our production items. So being able to maintain our own shipping account so we maintain our status more or less like with these shipping companies and being able to see, you know, the SLAs were important, the receiving fees, how things are being received in the inventory, timing and frequency, the. The time, the estimated time in transit to those different areas and being able to receive products in. So if we're boating products in how close they were to the port or what the time was, what the process was to get it to them if they would be able to take possession at port and get it to their warehouses or. We still had to coordinate that. So yeah, I had a long list of a bunch of different topics to go over when vetting the companies.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:26 - 00:09:28)
26 to be exact.
Megan O'Leary (00:09:29 - 00:09:35)
26 is what sticks out my mind. And I remember it was like 26 or 28 something like that questions that I was asking. So yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:37 - 00:09:41)
I'm going to, if you don't mind launch a little survey right here in the zoom.
Megan O'Leary (00:09:42 - 00:09:42)
Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:43 - 00:09:55)
And it, it's related to kind of what matters to you. It's not related to your perception of ship Bob. It's if you to rank these and how important they were to you when you were evaluating three PLs.
Megan O'Leary (00:09:56 - 00:09:56)
Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:01 - 00:10:03)
Let me know if you have any questions. But it should just pop up pretty easily.
Megan O'Leary (00:10:03 - 00:10:05)
Yep, it's here. Give me A second to read through it all.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:06 - 00:10:07)
Take your time.
Megan O'Leary (00:10:42 - 00:10:43)
Okay, got it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:43 - 00:10:57)
Awesome. Now, was there anything about your industry that you are looking for industry expertise in as you went to the three PLs?
Megan O'Leary (00:10:58 - 00:10:59)
No, not necessarily.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:00 - 00:11:31)
No. You imagine food or something like beauty products? People are looking for very specific vendors who have done a very certain thing. And so we kind of like to explore that. Who made it to the starting line of your evaluation or was it not? You said these kind of aggregated over time, but I imagine you hit this point where you're saying, hey, we may need a new vendor. Did you have a few people? You're like, okay, well, let's see if any of these three can do it, or is it not like that?
Megan O'Leary (00:11:33 - 00:12:56)
I evaluated over time because our needs had changed throughout years of what we were looking for. We were also sitting on the precipice of our lease expiring at our current facility. And so looking at the facilities and seeing like, okay, do we want to. Do we need to grow and just say, like, yes, we're going to bring this in house? Um, or are we going to be able to maintain the same size or downsize our facility by outsourcing some of this? Um, so we were sitting right on that. That precipice, which is where these conversations were happening fairly quickly. Um, so some of the rates I would say were like. When I received them from Ship Bob, that was the biggest driver for me was we got the rates. I took a look at what it was going to look like and I was like, this is going to be a lot more expensive than what we're paying for right now, which is going to take kind of to. My margin is actually just not going to end up being profitable for us if we were to that way. So that was the driver for me with not going forward with Ship Bob. Ultimately we decided to just go ahead and keep it in house. But I will say that the rates with shipbob were more expensive than competitors rates that we received. And it was a lot of like, they baked their margin into shipping costs. And so it didn't make sense for us to move forward with them as they wanted to use their shipping accounts, which in turn made it so we would have paid more in shipping for our items. And it just wouldn't have. It just wouldn't have worked out for us.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:56 - 00:13:13)
That makes sense. Now, beyond the price, we are looking to learn a bit about how the experience was getting the pricing from, like, the amount of time it took to the complexity of it. Is there anything you can share about either how easy or difficult it was or how long it took.
Megan O'Leary (00:13:15 - 00:14:42)
We pulled our information out of ShipStation, they gave us the criteria they needed. Uh, we passed that over. I will say that like the timeline, the deadlines that were provided to me by our account rep were missed. And so it took a little bit longer than we were hoping in order to get the pricing sent back over to us. But he did end up doing it like it was in an off hour. I want to say it was like in the middle and I was like 8, 9pm Something like that. And he ended up passing him over to me. So I was able to take a look at it over a weekend, but it wasn't in the original identified time frame if I remember correctly. So it took a little bit longer than we were hoping for. And then after I let them know that like, hey, this pricing didn't work. My biggest frustration with companies is when they say like, oh well, let me know it didn't work and I'll go back to my team and see what we can do normal. And it's like now, like we're good. I don't have time for like the back and forth and to kind of try and make it work for you all. And that's not necessarily just ship, Bob. It's, it's a strategy companies use. Right. Like they put it out there, we say no and then they kind of say like, okay, well let's go back and work on it. But at that point for me it's kind of like opportunities are gone because I'm not going to keep coming back if it didn't work the first time. I've already done the analysis. I'm not going to kind of keep digging into it in order to try to force what is a square peg in a round hole. So I'd say it was, it was fine. It just, I didn't want to have the back and forth to see if it was going to end up working.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:43 - 00:14:59)
Sure. And that deadline that was missed was that obviously should have been missed some third party. So there's no bias here. But was it something that he set and then missed or was it something you. Okay, so he said deadline was a couple weeks or what was it?
Megan O'Leary (00:15:00 - 00:15:19)
I believe if I'm remembering correct, I'd have to go back in order to remember and like take a look at the timelines on it. But I believe we said like, okay, we'll have pricing by the end of the week or something like that. And then it didn't show. He didn't get it enough time back from his team. And so they weren't able to. To kind of hit the original deadline for pricing. Over pricing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:20 - 00:15:43)
Yeah. If pricing matched your pricing and like it was set up in a way where you kept your own rates. Mm. Were the benefits of shipbob strong enough to have made a switch? Let's just say they were. Even with what you were doing?
Megan O'Leary (00:15:44 - 00:15:46)
Yeah, yeah, I would have made the switch.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:47 - 00:15:54)
What are the top strengths that would have made you make the switch even if pricing was on par with what you're paying today?
Megan O'Leary (00:15:55 - 00:17:05)
Um, in order, like the benefits? Is that what you're asking? Like, what would the benefits have been? So the benefits would have been we would have been able to reduce our warehouse size, which in turn would have saved us some money in order to not have to have as big as a facility. We would have been able to be more hands off as far as the. The day today, the assembly of the products. We would have been able to shift our internal focus on just, hey, let's make sure the buys are coming through, let's make sure inventory is correct. And then we would just be able to focus a lot more on production and growing that side of the business and allowing the piece that operates pretty autonomously to just continue to operate fairly autonomously. So the benefits would have been able to not be as distracted, I would say, especially as you go into key holiday time frames. But the big, we offer a lot of perks with like two day shipping, overnight shipping, full economy shipping, and so those add additional selling days. So making sure that all that criteria is met and we're using our shipping accounts is. Is a big, important piece of it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:06 - 00:17:30)
Yeah. If shipbob is thinking about a competitive lens, not only just how to serve you, but how to serve you better than, you know, the competitors. Is there anything that made ship up stand out in a positive or negative light? Let's put pricing aside that they could learn from your opinions. You looked at other vendors, what, what do you think they do well or worse than other people?
Megan O'Leary (00:17:30 - 00:18:18)
Yeah. So one thing that another competitor was offering was help with the inventory management. So as items like they would help make recommendations or let us know when things were getting low by evaluating the days of supply they had and how that product was turning out in order to send us a recommendation, hey, you're starting to get low in this warehouse. You need to place another order. Here's how much we recommend ordering based off of how this product is selling out of this warehouse. That takes a lot of the analysis and guesswork off of my end. So that was something that stood out to me. With another competitor, it's like even less work that we have to do because the issue with having things across multiple warehouses is you have to maintain inventory in those warehouses and they all sell differently. So it adds complexity. So I think that it's. That's an additional perk that could be offered by shipbomb.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:18 - 00:18:41)
Yeah. Awesome. One of my favorite questions to ask at the end of the conversation is if you were the CEO of Shipbob or had a product, what would you do to better serve a company like yours? And it can be shipbob specific or just three PL specific. But like, oh man, I wish that people did this. They would make my life easier.
Megan O'Leary (00:18:48 - 00:19:17)
I mean the vendor management piece is a big one. Right. Like being able to give a 3 PL the opportunity in order to just operate pretty autonomously. Hey, I'll give you contacts to my vendors and you can just kind of kick the PO over to me to approve when you pass it out. When you're running low on inventory and need to place another supply, we can give you the lead. Times like being able to manage the inventory and send us recommendations on purchases would be a huge one. Just to be able to take that additional load off and they do their own analysis.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:20 - 00:19:24)
That sounds really cool. And I haven't really heard that. Is that something that you've seen at all?
Megan O'Leary (00:19:26 - 00:20:13)
I've seen it through like inventory management companies inventory management system. So it's absolutely out there. Being able to have that be a part of the inventory process and. And that's being offered through three PL would wildly incentivized like a change because then it's even more hands off and you don't have to worry about it. And it just kind of operates on its own and a PO could just be kicked over. And I say, yep, that actually looks good. We have. That's an approved po. Go ahead and just send it over to my vendor. So that way it's. It's even more hands off and you're just kind of in the monitor stance. That would be a huge benefit. Huge, huge benefit. So that would probably be my biggest recommendation to a 3 PL company. Would just be just kind of the soup to nuts management.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:15 - 00:20:27)
Yeah. Is there anything on the product side that is worth providing feedback on things that in the technology or even the process that stood out as positive or negative?
Megan O'Leary (00:20:30 - 00:21:22)
Nothing necessarily. They offered tours their facility, which are fantastic. That's something that we can all take and learn from each other. How to make things Better. That's something that I would still love to learn from them and take advantage of. I know they have a facility here in Atlanta not too far from me by being able to just meet with them and understand their process and how they operate. But I think that the. I think the biggest things that kind of stood out was just the scale of shipbob, what they're able to do and how they're able to offer, and their strategy of just kind of putting their margin in their shipping prices. That makes it challenging when shipping carriers are so dynamic in their pricing. But, yeah, nothing super notable that I would say really stuck out.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:23 - 00:22:04)
I think you said something that's really interesting I haven't heard before, which is you. You run your own warehouse, and you're obviously trying to keep costs, like, all the things, very complex, and I'm always impressed by it. If shipbob did something like free education days, where they, like, invited people who ran their own warehouses to come visit their warehouses, it's like, cool. Hey, we do this many hundreds of millions of packages a year. Here's how we do it. Here's how we solve these problems. Come in. Just learn from us. And they'll be a product person, not a salesperson. That could be really good way to build rapport so that when you do need to go international or whatever, you've got a relationship.
Megan O'Leary (00:22:05 - 00:22:40)
Yeah, it's all about networking and just being able to learn from each other. And then, you know, you can always go in there for one of these, like, open education days. And you go in, you're like, wow, there's no way we can do this sort of thing. Like, look at what you guys are doing and asking questions, and you uncover more about the company and not a sales environment, which is. It can be a lot more open and inviting. And then it could end up still transpiring into a relationship from there by just doing it in more of a. A casual dynamic from an education standpoint, instead of a, hey, I need your business. Let's talk about that way.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:41 - 00:22:43)
Yeah. Do any vendors you have do that?
Megan O'Leary (00:22:46 - 00:23:14)
Not from an ops perspective. From, like, a product perspective. Yes. We worked with a 3 PL company over in Germany, and so we had that. We're able to go over there and view the facility. I viewed some for printing companies in North Carolina. I viewed some for another printing company down in Tijuana. So I've done it in a few different locations, but not for a 3 PL company of the caliber of like, a ship bomb.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:18 - 00:23:32)
One topic I don't feel like I asked enough about was just pre pricing process. You hear any feedback on the sales, engagement, the pitch and the demo and like not the product itself, but just how is that experience for you?
Megan O'Leary (00:23:33 - 00:24:48)
Yeah, there really wasn't a demo. I would say it was more of an intro call where we were talking about what I was looking for and then what they would be able to offer. So there was. There was a lot of conversation around who we are, what we're doing, what I'm looking for, the scale in which we were looking to. To do and then what Shipbob really was in the network. I would say there was a lot of conversation around. I wanted to start with one warehouse and he was asking why and would I consider going to multiple warehouses. And it really came down to the inventory management as to why I wouldn't want to do that. Which is again where that other piece could kind of come in handy saying like, okay, we'll manage the inventory for you and we'll move them around through the warehouses as need be. So. So yeah, I think that there really wasn't as much as a demo. Is that part of it? But it wasn't pushy. I would say very informative for them to understand a lot more about. And then I. I was able to. To ask the questions and understand a bit more about Shipbob and what makes them different in their eyes. But yeah. Does that answer your question?
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:49 - 00:24:49)
Yes.
Megan O'Leary (00:24:50 - 00:24:50)
Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:51 - 00:24:57)
Megan, it was a pleasure to meet you this morning. I hope you have a great Thursday and I appreciate your help.
Megan O'Leary (00:24:57 - 00:25:00)

Kristine Cass (00:00:03 - 00:00:04)
Hi. Good afternoon.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:05 - 00:00:06)
Hi, Christine. How are you?
Kristine Cass (00:00:06 - 00:00:07)
I'm doing well. How are you?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:07 - 00:00:08)
Happy Friday.
Kristine Cass (00:00:08 - 00:00:09)
Yes, to you too.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:11 - 00:00:42)
I run a research company, and Shipbob is a longtime client of ours, and they hired us as a third party to better serve their clients through research. And so we talked to people who evaluated them and chose them and evaluated them and didn't choose them. And so I'm grateful for your time. And for the next 20 minutes, I'll guide you through a set of questions, and you just answer whatever you're comfortable with. It is recorded with your permission and used privately only for Shipbob. Is that okay with you?
Kristine Cass (00:00:42 - 00:00:43)
That's okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:43 - 00:00:59)
Awesome. Well, I like to start by just getting some brief context questions out of the way. I got my notes over here. Most of the time I'll be talking to you, but let me just, for the beginning, get us set up. You are at Pink Stork, is that right? You're Christine Kass.
Kristine Cass (00:00:59 - 00:01:00)
Correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:00 - 00:01:07)
Fantastic. And what I have here is that you evaluated 3pls and chipbot, but chose not to go with them recently.
Kristine Cass (00:01:08 - 00:01:09)
Correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:09 - 00:01:12)
Great. And you're the Chief Financial Officer?
Kristine Cass (00:01:13 - 00:01:13)
Yes.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:13 - 00:01:27)
Great. Well, let's just get started with the question of what triggered your organization considering a new 3PL, and where were you starting from? If it was your own setup and warehouse or a different three pl?
Kristine Cass (00:01:28 - 00:02:30)
Yeah, so we currently. Sorry, I just have to turn the air off. It's a little loud. We currently manage our own warehouse, and every once in a while, we really want to make sure that we are doing what's best for our company and staying up to date with all the latest technology and processes just that are. That are important for our industry. And so last quarter, part of what I was focusing on was reviewing a lot of our practices and. And really our organizational setup to make sure that we were. We had the best setup for where we are today. And so we hadn't evaluated 3pls seriously in probably since COVID So it had been a while, and the. The marketplace had changed. The way Amazon manages shipments, the way customers expect website shipments to go through, all of that has evolved. And so this was a good time for us to evaluate whether Moving to A3PL would be preferable to maintaining our. Our own internal warehouse.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:31 - 00:02:34)
Awesome. And what criteria did you have when you looked at options?
Kristine Cass (00:02:36 - 00:02:50)
Well, cost, of course, the cost is obviously a factor, but one of the big factors for us was flexibility. So I would say cost efficiency and flexibility were the three factors that we were looking at.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:50 - 00:02:55)
How were you defining flexibility for us?
Kristine Cass (00:02:55 - 00:04:00)
I think One of the things. And this actually, this was the, the deal breaker. This was the. Ended up being the most important factor. Once we identified that the others were okay. We for our business like to stay very nimble, which means for us that we like to be able to move very fast on Amazon. And sometimes that can require us to do things with inventory that A3PL isn't set up for. And so that flexibility was, was the deciding factor for us. So for instance, we sell dietary supplements. So for instance, like if we have this bottle, we decide, hey, the market has shifted on Amazon. We need to change the label. Right. We need to be able to order labels, get them in within a week and have our people sit down and take this label off and put another label on and ship it out to Amazon. And so while that's not the majority of our, of our work, we do need to be able to maintain that. That capability. And that's something that we thought that we would lose with a 3 PL.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:01 - 00:04:22)
Yeah, sure. I am going to bring up a little poll if that's okay, right here in the, in the zoom experience. And it is about criteria and it's not about Shipbob. It's just about. As you talk to 3pls, how important were these different criteria to you?
Kristine Cass (00:04:25 - 00:04:50)
Okay, so, okay, so global is not really a priority. We don't do a lot of. Or I guess it's a very low priority. We don't do a lot of global shipments. So that's not as impactful for us. Power Omnichannel through power growth through Omnichannel and Headless Fulfillment. I'm not sure what headless fulfillment is.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:51 - 00:04:56)
Yeah, Omni Channel, it's, you know, multi.
Kristine Cass (00:04:56 - 00:04:58)
I know what Omnichannel, but what is headless?
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:58 - 00:05:09)
I'm sorry, I'm working it through kind of my. Myself with that. That might be. These are questions they guided me to. You know, I'm not sure we can just make it neutral.
Kristine Cass (00:05:11 - 00:05:25)
Let's say omnichannel, excluding headless. My guess is what that means is that our internal heads don't have to think about it. Right. Because it's automatic or automated from. From our internal standpoint or.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:25 - 00:05:26)
Sure.
Kristine Cass (00:05:26 - 00:05:50)
Doing the labor there. Power growth through Omni channel. Omni channel is less of a priority for us. I'm going to go with medium priority here. Enable customization at scale. To me, customization doesn't scale. So when I think about that, I think enabling customization, I kind of think about that as flexibility, but that's not scale.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:51 - 00:06:05)
So I'll Tell you what they intend for that they have plenty of clients who, you know, kit in different things based on different orders where they maybe a VIP batch of customers might get this sort of treatment and notes and tissue paper.
Kristine Cass (00:06:06 - 00:06:28)
I mean if, if that's what you mean by that, then yeah, that is, that is a high priority. I think that that piece of the puzzle that like kidding and custom gift wrap, that sort of stuff. Yes, that honestly. Well, that is an essential. It's. It's necessary but it's not sufficient for us. So while I do think that shipbob was able to handle that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:29 - 00:06:29)
Yeah.
Kristine Cass (00:06:29 - 00:06:38)
We. The, the customization that we need is significantly greater than what shipbob was able to handle.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:38 - 00:06:38)
Sure.
Kristine Cass (00:06:39 - 00:06:58)
Deliver fast, reliable, fast and cost effective fulfillment. That's obviously essential. Inspire trust through fantastic service and actionable insights. I think trust is. That's probably. I think there's a lot of, a lot of pieces wrapped up into this inspiring trust. Having trust in our. Any partner is essential.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:59 - 00:06:59)
Yeah.
Kristine Cass (00:06:59 - 00:07:16)
Through fantastic service. Yes. Actionable insights. That's less. I'm not looking to Ship Bob to provide me information like that. Sort of the dashboard to me is a little bit less important. But the actionable, inspiring trust through fantastic service. That's essential.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:16 - 00:07:20)
Great. Can you submit that?
Kristine Cass (00:07:21 - 00:07:22)
Yes, I just did.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:22 - 00:07:45)
Okay, great. Thank you so much. Oh, there it is. Okay. Now some clients of Ship Bob's or prospects of Shipbob are really looking for a vendor with a very specific experience. You could imagine food products or some beauty products. They're looking for people who have like done fragrances before for your industry. How important is industry specific experience?
Kristine Cass (00:07:49 - 00:07:52)
I wouldn't say it's essential. I do think it would.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:52 - 00:07:52)
It.
Kristine Cass (00:07:52 - 00:08:04)
It is a important. Nice to have. Yeah, I think it would, it would help build trust if I know that they have clients that are in our industry and understand what's required to support our customers.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:05 - 00:08:12)
How would you rank ship up on well suited for your industry? From 0 to 10? If 10 was perfectly suited?
Kristine Cass (00:08:13 - 00:08:14)
I would say 10.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:14 - 00:08:21)
Yeah. Well, great. Did you look what other vendors did you look at?
Kristine Cass (00:08:22 - 00:09:00)
We weren't looking at a lot of other 3pls. We were really looking at do we want a 3pl and ship Bob was our kind of. It was honestly the only one I looked at and if we went with a 3 PL, we would have gone with ship up. I think they have a really great record in the 3 PL industry and their scale gave us a lot of confidence. So if we were going to go with 3PL, we would have got with ship up. So we were really comparing not ship off versus other 3PLs, but shipbob 3PL versus default internal warehouse versus a more holistic approach through Pattern, which essentially would own our e commerce business.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:02 - 00:09:12)
I want to hear about Pattern, but I want to miss on a comment you made, which is just Ship up had maybe the best record among three PLs, I think was the statement. What gave you that impression?
Kristine Cass (00:09:14 - 00:09:31)
I just heard about shipbob. Seen them referenced in plenty of places. Whether it's through industry list lists that I'm on or chats that I'm on, the reviews are strong. I think they just have that reputation in the industry as being a very big player in the 3PL space.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:32 - 00:09:43)
Yeah, if nothing comes to mind or you don't want to, that's fine. But what kind of lists are you talking about? If shipbob is looking to continue to promote themselves where it should be value.
Kristine Cass (00:09:44 - 00:10:01)
It'S not necessarily hearing about them from, you know, marketing lists. It's more about, you know, I'm, I'm in a bunch of groups, whether it's WhatsApp groups or email groups or LinkedIn groups of e commerce sellers. And I hear Ship Bob referenced as a. As a solid three PL by them.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:01 - 00:10:06)
Got it, got it. You mentioned pattern. What is that?
Kristine Cass (00:10:07 - 00:10:49)
It's a completely different business model. So, you know, when we currently sell as an e commerce seller, we are the seller of record for our products on Amazon. And with Pattern, they would be the seller of records. So essentially we would sell our products wholesale to Pattern and they would manage the listings, the fulfillment, customer service, everything. So it'd be more of a wholesale relationship. We'd be essentially outsourcing our entire Amazon business as opposed to just outsourcing the fulfillment piece. Outsourcing our entire Amazon business to Pattern. And part of that is gaining access to their fulfillment networks, which have the best internal technology to support Amazon sellers.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:50 - 00:10:56)
And did you end up going with them or staying in house?
Kristine Cass (00:10:56 - 00:11:59)
Staying in house. And the reason we. So there's a couple of reasons here. Giving up. If we went with Pattern, we would be giving up a lot of control in and for our business. That was too much control for us to relinquish given the stage of business that we're at. So we weren't comfortable with that. And so given that we weren't going to move with them, the question became, okay, do we want to switch to 3 PL or maintain our own warehouse? And when I looked at the cost breakdown, the cost came out roughly similar. I think that shiphab would save us a decent chunk on shipping costs, but the labor costs would be significantly higher. We run a pretty low cost labor. We're in a low labor cost area and we run our warehouse pretty efficiently. So the ship, the labor cost would be higher with Ship Bob, the freight cost would be lower, kind of evened out. And so the cost wasn't really a deciding factor. There wasn't enough of a cost advantage to overcome the, the loss of flexibility.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:00 - 00:12:12)
And I think I heard it but just see crystal clear the. It was the loss of control for pattern. Well, what if you didn't feel that? What do you think their greatest strengths.
Kristine Cass (00:12:12 - 00:12:42)
Are with pattern or pattern? Oh, pattern is their technology, their scale and their technology, not just on the logistics side. So like logistics is one piece of the puzzle. It's. It's the scale and technology for inbound logistics to Amazon, shipping from their warehouses to Amazon combined with all the technology for listing optimization and ad support and all of that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:44 - 00:12:48)
And you said listing optimization and ad support. Can you tell me just a little bit more about what they did?
Kristine Cass (00:12:49 - 00:13:30)
So they have a lot of technology that optimizes the Amazon listing. So the images, the titles, the bullets, the enhanced content, like everything that you're seeing on the product detail page on Amazon, they have technology that does automatic optimization on that based on keyword volume and performance. They're optimizing those pages on a day to day basis in a way that we don't have. We're doing that manually. So like we don't have the technology to do that. They're also doing the same with the a Amazon ads. They're optimizing those ad campaigns on an ongoing basis in a much more automated way than we are.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:30 - 00:13:46)
Got it. It is really like from, from initial traffic through the page itself to distributing the product and just that leaves you to manufacture great products and build, build a brand that someone would search for.
Kristine Cass (00:13:46 - 00:13:46)
Right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:47 - 00:13:48)
Wow, cool.
Kristine Cass (00:13:48 - 00:13:49)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:51 - 00:14:08)
I want to ask you, so you mentioned flexibility was the biggest reason you didn't go with Ship bob or any other 3 PL. Were there any other weaknesses or barriers if that was not the case to call out that Shibab can learn from?
Kristine Cass (00:14:09 - 00:14:38)
No. I actually really enjoyed the time that I spent with the sales rep. I thought he was very, he was, he was great. I really enjoyed the time spoke with him. He was very responsive, very clear, very trustworthy. No complaints or concerns about him. I thought he was great to work with. So I appreciate his time. It was really the. There wasn't enough of a cost advantage to make up for the loss in flexibility.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:38 - 00:15:03)
Got it. How about. I think you said you got, you did get pricing from them. I'm actually curious, in addition to the price, how did the process go? Like, how did the, was it burdensome to collect the data? How long did it take for you to get the pricing back? And did it like match what they promised, the timelines?
Kristine Cass (00:15:04 - 00:15:28)
Yeah, no, I thought the process was fine. He gave me clear instructions about what data that they, what data they needed. I was able to download that pretty seamlessly from shipstation. I don't think it took me more than a half hour to kind of clean up the data and provide them what they needed. And they, I, I don't remember the exact timeline turnaround time, but it was definitely well within my expectations. I don't recall having to wait for him for, for a long time.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:28 - 00:15:45)
Got it. The. We talked about kind of the weaknesses and you referenced a lot of positives, but if you don't mind, we can be kind of explicit about the things you really liked about ship. Bob, you said the scale mind kind of touching on some of those other things.
Kristine Cass (00:15:46 - 00:17:09)
Yeah. I think that the scale is important because it shows a confidence in the industry. Right. When shipments are late, we get dinged across platforms, so we just can't have that. It's kind of like a zero tolerance. Right. If we get dinged too much, then TikTok shop takes us down, we get customer complaints, all that. So the, the scale gave me confidence that shipbob would be able to meet our standards and our customers standards and that we work with standards for shipping, which is essential. Right. But so I didn't have any concerns about that. The scale gave me concerns. I, or gave me confidence. I think the technology also looked good. Like I didn't have. The dashboard looked fine. I didn't have any. It was not lacking in any way. Certainly a little bit different from what we do internally where we're. Got a couple different systems we're cobbling together. The system looked, looked like it would be very productive and easy to navigate. So no concerns there. The only concern I had was concerns relating to the flexibility. So for instance, you mentioned like customers wanting to add inserts in or clients wanting to add vendors, whatever we call them brands wanting to add inserts into packages. Right. So that's important to us. But what it did seem like was that, you know, we like to change our mind on that regularly.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:10 - 00:17:10)
Yeah.
Kristine Cass (00:17:10 - 00:17:51)
And that's the piece where it's like, okay, yeah, maybe they, in theory they could handle that, but could they really turn that On a dime, you know, if we say, oh, yeah, we've got all these inserts, but no, starting Monday, we want to add in a different insert or in these types of packages, we want to have these two inserts or, hey, now we're doing TikTok shop orders. So those need to have a different insert or they need to go in a different type of packaging. And while I think, in theory, I think shipbob would be able to handle that, I don't think they'd be able to handle it with the speed. Yeah, because it would be. We have to kind of go through those requests with. I know that there are some of those that you could put through the portal, but we would need confirmation from a real person that. That those were happening.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:52 - 00:18:33)
I get it. I do wonder is, do you think this is a kind of. This is who the business is and it's core to everything you do at Pink Stork? Or do you. Can you imagine as you continue to grow and see success at scale that, I don't know, you. You structure that a little differently or you're willing to sacrifice that. That total flexibility for scale to get help? Like, whether it's ship up or not, you know, how do you envision the next kind of three years and how. How you maintain that?
Kristine Cass (00:18:34 - 00:19:56)
I don't envision us getting rid of the warehouse in three years. You know, if we talk about 20, 30, maybe. There's also real estate factors involved, like we own the warehouse, so, you know, getting rid of the warehouse, you know, outsourcing fulfillment is one piece. We're also holding inventory and all of that. And like, just outsourcing the web store would get rid of one part of what our warehouse does, but there's other parts that our warehouse would still do. And that was another reason, you know, when we. And I should bring that up. But another reason. Another consideration that I had is that while I have strong confidence that shipbob could handle the web store fulfillment orders coming from pinkstor.com that go through Shopify and get sent out and probably TikTok shop fulfillment, too. We could hook that up to Shifob. The. The piece that's. The vast majority of our business is shipping products direct to Amazon's warehouse. The FBA orders and those, I had a little bit less confidence in shipbob to handle. And, you know, that's. That. I know they. They assured me that they can handle that, but I don't think that they're used to businesses that have our structure. Right. Like, for us, that's 90% of the volume that goes out the door and the web store orders and the TikTok shop, that's 10%. So we'd be talking about outsourcing the 10% and keeping the 90%. And at that point, does it really make sense to do it? You know, we're only getting rid of the 10%.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:57 - 00:20:02)
Yeah. What, what gave you less confidence that they could handle the Amazon.
Kristine Cass (00:20:04 - 00:20:25)
Again? It's the speed. You know, we like to be able to make decisions on those very quickly. So if we're seeing, hey, this product is selling well today, we need to get another order up this afternoon. You know, we could put that into the system. Okay, we could put that into the system, but I'm not confident we'll get out that day. Oh, excuse me one second.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:25 - 00:20:26)
No problem.
Kristine Cass (00:20:35 - 00:20:35)
Sorry about that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:36 - 00:20:55)
No problem. I've got, I don't know if that's kids or not, but I've got two little ones running around in my meetings. Yeah, you. I'm just getting personally curious, like, what, what, what do you change same day within Amazon? This world fascinates me.
Kristine Cass (00:20:57 - 00:21:29)
A couple things. So, for instance, we have, we have products that we have the same, you know, stuff in the bottle that we sell under a couple labels, couple different labels just to different customer groups. And so it might be, hey, you know, one of those is taking off. We need to send more in. And to do that, we might have to relabel a product that's sitting here labeled as something else to the one that's doing well and ship it out the door. And so that's not something that ship out could turn around same day. Yeah, or maybe they could, but it would be a real interruption to their process. Right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:30 - 00:21:37)
That's such a cool way to. You're like, it's, it's both different segmentations and like a B testing.
Kristine Cass (00:21:38 - 00:22:17)
Yeah, exactly. We do a lot of pivoting. And so, you know, while I think ship up would work really well for business, that's very stable. And yes, 95% of our orders are coming from very stable products. There's always those one off things that happen. And there's also, there are manufacturing issues that happen or the manufacturer put the wrong label on and now we need to, or we need to quarantine this stock and whatever. And, and I think shipbob can handle those edge cases, but maybe not as quickly or as seamlessly as we could do it in house.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:17 - 00:22:32)
Yeah, that makes sense. I'd say one of my favorite questions for the end, which is you are if if you are head of product at or just CEO of Ship up, what would you do to better serve companies like Pink Stork.
Kristine Cass (00:22:34 - 00:24:10)
Amazon Inbound? I would say, you know, looking through, understanding a little bit more about what Pattern's doing on the Amazon Inbound side and replicating that without the pattern business model. So one of the things that they do is they, you know, when we send a shipment to Amazon, we go through Amazon's back end. It says, do you want to send an inventory? We click the buttons, it tells us where to send it, how much to send, we pack the shipment and it goes off. And we're subject to whatever, wherever Amazon told us to ship it, and whatever the check in time at that destination is, we're just stuck with it. So if we, if Amazon sent it to a warehouse that was backed up, that product could be sitting there waiting for up to 10 days before it gets checked in, which means that our customers can order it. You know, Pattern has started to find workarounds to this where they're, they have their system constantly scanning the Amazon delivery centers or Amazon fulfillment centers available delivery time slots. And so their, their system is scanning that constantly. When it finds an open time slot, it grabs it and then figures out, okay, what can we put on a truck to go and fills an entire truck. So like, if Amazon, if Ship up has enough volume going to Amazon, that's a business model right there. And while I know, I think that the Ship Bob option right now for Amazon is kind of what we're doing already, like that's not an advantage, it's just doing what we're doing today with a little bit less flexibility. But if it could use the technology to kind of reduce that lead time to get into Amazon, that would be an advantage.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:11 - 00:24:14)
That's a golden nugget, Christine. Thank you.
Kristine Cass (00:24:14 - 00:24:15)
You're welcome.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:16 - 00:24:23)
Is there anything that I haven't asked you about that you thought I might have or things that you think Chip up could benefit from hearing from that we haven't discussed?
Kristine Cass (00:24:24 - 00:24:30)
No, the only, I guess the only thing I'd say is that the rep was really great. So five stars for the rep. Great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:31 - 00:24:34)
Well, I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you so much for your time.
Kristine Cass (00:24:34 - 00:24:35)
Thank you. Have a great weekend.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:36 - 00:24:36)
Bye.
Kristine Cass (00:24:36 - 00:24:37)
Bye. Bye.

Drew Giovannoli (00:00:02 - 00:00:24)
So just so you know, the recording, along with the transcript of the interview is going to be used to create a report that's going to be shared with our client Shipbob. And all the materials from the recording, the transcript and the report really going to be shared with Shipbob to help them gain valuable insights and perspectives from, you know, folks like yourself. So, any questions?
Leo Wan (00:00:26 - 00:00:26)
No?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:27 - 00:00:37)
Okay, awesome. Let's dive in. So to start off, what prompted you to evaluate a new or different 3pl solution?
Leo Wan (00:00:40 - 00:01:04)
There are several aspects of it. The first thing is definitely cost, number one priority for us at this time. The second is the functionality, like how easy to access or how easy like for our team to pick up. Yeah, I would say these two are the main focus of. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:06 - 00:01:15)
Yep. Great. And then was it that your previous solution was not meeting your expectations as it relates to cost and functionality?
Leo Wan (00:01:17 - 00:01:41)
No, I mean we are constantly looking at, to find like a better or like cheaper solution. We are always open to explore, you know, new opportunities or like any way if there is a better cost or better 3PL solution out there, it's available. So. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:42 - 00:01:48)
Awesome. So it sounds like it's a constant pursuit of seeing if there's something better.
Leo Wan (00:01:49 - 00:01:50)
Yes, correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:50 - 00:02:00)
Yeah, that's great. So in thinking about this most recent process, what were your evaluation criteria? I know you talked about cost and functionality. Were there others?
Leo Wan (00:02:04 - 00:02:58)
I would say cost, functionality, like yeah, pretty much the same. Cost is our, at this point of our business, cost is our like number one focus and functionality wise. I mean we are, we're a smaller company and like, we don't need like need the solution to be too fancy and you know, we, we. Yeah. So basically just like looking for solution that cost with a good price and suitable for our business model at this time. That's what we are looking at right now. And definitely, I mean like the quality of service, that's one thing we look at as well. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:59 - 00:03:11)
Tell me a little bit more about us. So you mentioned cost. Tell me, tell me more about how you think about a good price or what constitutes an attractive price from your standpoint.
Leo Wan (00:03:15 - 00:03:49)
I don't have, I don't have a data on hand with me right now. But basically it's like. Yeah, basically how we would compare is like, you know, we have some data, how much, how much, how many, like shipment. We go out like each month and then we kind of take that scenario. If you put in some other solutions, if they can come back with better pricing, then that's how, how we would determine if that's a, you know, good pricing or not. Basically it's compared to our current service.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:49 - 00:04:13)
Yes, compared to the current service. Okay, great, understood. Let's let me ask you this as a follow up. Where they're in terms of the, you know, obviously cost as compared to the others in terms of the functionality and any other criteria. Would you say there's any needs that are specific to your particular industry that you were considering?
Leo Wan (00:04:25 - 00:04:27)
Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't think of any.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:29 - 00:05:04)
Yep, fair enough. So now I want to switch gears a little bit. I'm going to give you a few different criteria factors and I'd love for you to just help me out with the score. I will go one by one, but let me give you the scoring framework because it's based on priority where one is not a priority and then it scales up all the way to five where it's essential. Right, okay. So I'll give you the criteria and you tell me if it's a one to five. Okay, great. So the first one is inspire trust through fantastic service and actionable insights.
Leo Wan (00:05:10 - 00:05:15)
Let's say there's a four.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:16 - 00:05:23)
Very good. The next one is deliver reliable, fast and cost effective fulfillment.
Leo Wan (00:05:24 - 00:05:24)
Five.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:24 - 00:05:54)
That's a five. Yep. This next one is enable customization at scale three. Number four is simplify global and cross border fulfillment. And the last one is power growth through omnichannel and headless fulfillment.
Leo Wan (00:05:58 - 00:05:59)
What does that mean? Headless fulfillment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:59 - 00:06:04)
And yeah, just think about it from the multi channel standpoint.
Leo Wan (00:06:04 - 00:06:05)
Oh, okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:06 - 00:06:06)
Mm.
Leo Wan (00:06:10 - 00:06:11)
Three.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:11 - 00:06:34)
Three. Okay. Awesome. That was very helpful. Thanks for playing on that one. Let's move on to another. I have another scale question for you. We like scales. So this next one is on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is not suited at all and 10 is perfectly suited. So the question is how well suited do you believe shipbob is to your industry?
Leo Wan (00:06:39 - 00:06:45)
Ship Bob, in a perfect scenario you say.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:45 - 00:06:51)
Well, as, as you've observed, Ship Bob through your evaluation.
Leo Wan (00:06:53 - 00:06:54)
I say a nine.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:54 - 00:06:56)
A nine. Okay, so it sounds like they're.
Leo Wan (00:06:58 - 00:06:58)
Well.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:58 - 00:07:05)
Suited for the industry. Tell me, what were some of the things that may have stood out to put you in a position to score them that way?
Leo Wan (00:07:08 - 00:07:43)
I mean as I was talking to Shipton the other time, basically he, he understood everything that, that our meats are and like most of the, on the most part I feel like, I feel like shipbox like functionality are able to like meet what our needs are. Yeah, that's great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:43 - 00:08:05)
And do you feel like the solution, would you say it the, the score that you ascribe to it and your experience, would you. Would you say that that makes it attractive to the industry? So others who offer similar products to you or do you think it's specific to your company?
Leo Wan (00:08:07 - 00:08:10)
Yeah, I feel like it's. Yeah. Attractive enough.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:13 - 00:08:15)
To the industry or your, your company or both?
Leo Wan (00:08:16 - 00:08:16)
Both.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:17 - 00:08:45)
Both. Okay, very good. So let's kind of go a little bit deeper. So we're there. Thinking about your most recent exercise where you looked at different solutions, were there any other vendors that seem to be a good fit for the industry, for your industry? This could be the vendor you are that you ended up going with or staying with a different vendor you evaluated or one that you're aware of but they didn't evaluate?
Leo Wan (00:08:47 - 00:08:48)
No, not at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:51 - 00:08:58)
Great. So what were some of. Or who were some of the other vendors that you evaluated.
Leo Wan (00:09:09 - 00:09:19)
With it evaluate? Let me see, what was the name of that ship? Hero.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:20 - 00:09:21)
Ship Hero. Okay.
Leo Wan (00:09:23 - 00:09:36)
And then I think that will be the most recent one that we, that we looked at and. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:37 - 00:09:37)
Yep.
Leo Wan (00:09:38 - 00:09:39)
I can't remember the others.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:40 - 00:09:44)
Yes. And then who did you end up deciding on?
Leo Wan (00:09:46 - 00:09:54)
I mean, we always been using shipstation, so we are sticking with shipstation at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:56 - 00:10:08)
And so. Yeah, that's great. When, as you were running your evaluation, at what point was shipbob eliminated from the evaluation process?
Leo Wan (00:10:12 - 00:11:32)
So it was after. Let me see. How can I. How do I put this? So it wasn't. There's no, not, not like a point of like, eliminated, but it just. We, we got caught up with like, some, we were focusing on some other, like, aspect in the company at, in the company at the moment. So we kind of put that project on the side. And, and, and I mean, we're, we, we're not like, dissatisfied with what we have currently, so there's not like an urgent need to switch it right away. So there wasn't. So that's why I said, like, there wasn't a, like. No, no, no. But like, we kind of put the project on the side at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:33 - 00:11:49)
Yes, understood. Were you ever able to get a proposal from shipub or what did you basically redirect attention to other things before the proposal?
Leo Wan (00:11:51 - 00:12:01)
We redirect to the other stuff before the proposal. Yeah, got it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:01 - 00:12:20)
Okay, very good. And so it sounds like you stuck with shipstation. What is it about shipstation that you feel like is most compelling over shipbob?
Leo Wan (00:12:24 - 00:12:40)
I mean, like, to be honest, we just haven't. Like I said, we haven't got the full proposal, so there wasn't. I would say we don't have. Know Enough to say no to Ship up?
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:41 - 00:12:41)
Yes.
Leo Wan (00:12:42 - 00:12:51)
So yeah like I mentioned, we just had some other aspect in the business we need to focus on at this moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:51 - 00:12:52)
Yeah.
Leo Wan (00:12:52 - 00:13:21)
So that's. Yeah. So there's not. I mean we use a key still using shipstation just because we are familiar with it, the pricing are good and that's it. Not saying shipbob is not good compared to Ship Station. We just switch to other. We just have other things to focus at this time.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:21 - 00:13:38)
Yes. Understood. Given what you know about shipbob and recognizing that it's not complete. Right. There's more to know. But what do you perceive to be shipbob's strengths versus others?
Leo Wan (00:13:39 - 00:13:43)
I'll say the functionality. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:44 - 00:13:53)
Are there any specific functions that are especially relevant to your long term interest or the business?
Leo Wan (00:14:10 - 00:14:42)
Let me see if I still have some notes from. I would say it's. Is that a full stack fulfillment platform thing? That's like.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:45 - 00:14:45)
Yeah.
Leo Wan (00:14:46 - 00:14:52)
And then I'm really impressed with that, that phone app that they have as well.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:52 - 00:14:53)
Ah yes.
Leo Wan (00:14:54 - 00:15:04)
Yeah that's something that we don't have or we're not using at the moment. But yeah I can see that it is kind of cool.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:04 - 00:15:19)
Yep. So the mobile app, that's great. So in thinking about the other side of that continuum, do you have any perspective on shipbob's weaknesses versus others?
Leo Wan (00:15:23 - 00:15:25)
I can't think of any at this moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:28 - 00:15:38)
I do know that you're with ShipStation. What would you say are some of the most compelling attributes of Shipstation as it relates to your industry?
Leo Wan (00:15:45 - 00:16:12)
I mean it's easy access, can connect it to like a lot of the tools that you're using. For example our ERP system, also our Shopify like page and like it's a connect connectivity. Yes, that helps. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:13 - 00:16:25)
Okay great. And then how is from your standpoint how does shipstation stack up relative to the marketplace around price.
Leo Wan (00:16:30 - 00:16:59)
As of right now we haven't found like, like a, a better pricing of the 3P solution then ship Station. I haven't like, like I said except for like Ship Bob. I have. We haven't gone into that div yet. Yeah but at the, at the moment we haven't found anything that like provides what we need with such a low price.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:59 - 00:17:00)
Yeah. Better price. Yes.
Leo Wan (00:17:00 - 00:17:22)
With a better price or because like we're not like we, we're not like fancy we. We just like using like we, we're pretty simple on like in terms of our fulfillment. So a lot of the like for example shipbob, like you guys provide a lot of Functionality but like a lot of the things that we, we don't need it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:22 - 00:17:22)
Right.
Leo Wan (00:17:23 - 00:17:34)
So that being said, like yeah, ShipStation can provide like our basic needs with low cost. That's pretty much what it was.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:35 - 00:17:46)
Yeah, that makes sense. In thinking about the shipbob sales team, do you, do you recall anything that they did well?
Leo Wan (00:17:47 - 00:18:28)
Yeah, Shipton I think only spoke to him. He was really friendly. He's knowledgeable, really relatable to a lot of things that we are doing. So he kind of, by, by talking to him he kind of know like understand our three PL models are and like what are some of the needs and it wasn't pushy. He was really good at explaining like what he has and like understanding basically what our needs is. Yeah, the, the whole meeting was, was, was good with him.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:28 - 00:18:39)
That's great, that's great to hear. In thinking about that sales experience, is there anything that you think the sales team could have done better?
Leo Wan (00:18:41 - 00:18:42)
No, I think he did great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:47 - 00:19:03)
You said we didn't. My next question is around pricing process but it doesn't sound like you actually got a formal proposal. Do you know anything about chipstation pricing or do you have a perspective on pricing as it relates to shipbob?
Leo Wan (00:19:06 - 00:19:11)
I'll need to go back and check. I don't have a data on top of my head.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:16 - 00:19:51)
Fair enough. I just have some pricing questions here. I just want to make sure they're applicable to you. Here's an interesting question because oftentimes with these three PL platform providers there is an exercise where they request information from you in terms of the number of shipments and you know the right. The elements of your product and then they go away and they come back with a proposal. Right. So what do you think is a reasonable turnaround time to receive pricing once you give them the data?
Leo Wan (00:19:56 - 00:20:16)
Well, I mean ideally I would expect like within, I'll say most optimal. I would say a day or two on a reasonable timeline would be like like a week.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:16 - 00:20:17)
Yes.
Leo Wan (00:20:18 - 00:20:45)
Yeah. And that, that, that's kind of how I look at it. Like you know, if it, you can get it one or two days perfect within a week. I mean still good. Yeah, I mean, I mean for us like we, we kind of mentioned we are not like, like you know, in a hurry or in an urgent switching to another platform or switch solution. So like yeah, I would say generally a week it's fine.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:45 - 00:21:05)
Okay, that's great. And follow up question on that. How, how would you prefer to engage with the pricing information? Is, is an, an email obviously with the details sufficient or Would you want to have a conversation with a sales rep about the pricing?
Leo Wan (00:21:06 - 00:21:15)
I would say email first and then there's anything that not understanding. Well, I need to be clarified that follow up with by ourselves rep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:16 - 00:21:17)
Okay, great.
Leo Wan (00:21:19 - 00:21:20)
That's great.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:22 - 00:21:35)
So here's a question. Hypothetical. If you were to leave shipstation in nine months. So this is thinking into the future. What. What's happened to cause that change?
Leo Wan (00:21:41 - 00:21:46)
I mean it's the go back to our. Our need. It's.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:46 - 00:21:46)
Yes.
Leo Wan (00:21:47 - 00:21:58)
Like a service that with good pricing at the same time can meet our need. That's. Yeah. With better pricing than Substation. That. What I am saying is.
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:59 - 00:22:10)
Yes. So if you were to have found a situation that met your needs with a better price, then that could be one of the reasons why you leave shipstation at some point in the future. Yep.
Leo Wan (00:22:10 - 00:22:11)
Correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:11 - 00:22:22)
That makes a lot of sense. So last question. If you were the CEO of shipbob, what would you change to better serve a company like yours?
Leo Wan (00:22:27 - 00:22:33)
I mean. Yeah. I mean just better pricing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:34 - 00:22:35)
There's a big.
Leo Wan (00:22:36 - 00:23:01)
Yeah. I mean that's a focus of our business right now and you know. Yeah, that's. That's the whole. Yeah. Pricing with. You know, with remaining the quality of service. Obviously put it this way. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:01 - 00:23:08)
Are there specific elements of a service experience that are most important to you?
Leo Wan (00:23:10 - 00:23:50)
I would say, I'll say is how easy to access the help from ship up. Like for example, like if there's. If there's things that needs to be troubleshoot, if there's anyone to help, how easily to reach to ship up to for help and how. How they handle the case. I will say that will be the number one thing.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:51 - 00:23:55)
Very good. So good price and strong case management.
Leo Wan (00:23:56 - 00:23:57)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:58 - 00:24:09)
Awesome. Is there anything else about either your shipbob or shipstation experience that you think is noteworthy?
Leo Wan (00:24:10 - 00:24:15)
No. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:15 - 00:24:37)
Well, Leo, this has been great. Time flew by. I appreciate your time and sharing your perspective with me. We'll go ahead and get all this information over to Ship up to help them improve their process in terms of housekeeping. You'll receive an email from our partner. Tremendous. Within the next 24 hours and tremendous coordinates your payment for today's session.
Leo Wan (00:24:38 - 00:24:40)
All right? Sure. Thank you so much, Nick.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:40 - 00:24:41)
All right, Leo, take care. Bye Bye.
Leo Wan (00:24:41 - 00:24:42)
Okay, bye.

Hey.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:18 - 00:03:19)
Hi Morgan, how are you?
Morgan Lee (00:03:19 - 00:03:20)
I'm good, how are you?
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:21 - 00:03:23)
I'm well. Thanks for making time today.
Morgan Lee (00:03:23 - 00:03:24)
Yeah, no problem.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:25 - 00:03:37)
I. I was just checking out Sarah Silks while I was waiting for you. And I've got a seven year old daughter and a four year old son who I think be pretty excited if I showed them some of this stuff.
Morgan Lee (00:03:38 - 00:03:39)
That's awesome. Well, I hope you do.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:39 - 00:04:13)
Yeah, it's the perfect, perfect age range. Hey, let me give you some quick context. I surf Shipbot by interviewing customers and prospects, people who chose them, people who didn't. All in the aim of improving their service. Right. Getting, getting improving how they they sell and what they offer. And so with your permission, for the next about 20 minutes, I will learn from you. Just ask you questions in a casual way, answer whatever you feel comfortable with and it is recorded, but for private uses, Shibab only.
Morgan Lee (00:04:14 - 00:04:15)
Sounds good.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:16 - 00:04:25)
Great, thanks. Let me just make sure I get the information right. I have you as a CFO of Sarah Silks and, and that you evaluated but did not go with Shipbob. Is that all correct?
Morgan Lee (00:04:25 - 00:04:26)
Yeah, that's right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:26 - 00:04:39)
Awesome. Can you tell me what kind of warehousing fulfillment you were using and what motivated you to start evaluating three PLs?
Morgan Lee (00:04:39 - 00:05:00)
Yeah, so we currently use the Flexport 3PL and we were just looking at the, the switching cost would look like. And then also kind of just comparing the pricing models between Chipbob and a couple other 3pls and then also what we were currently using, which is Flexport. Yeah, that was kind of the impetus.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:01 - 00:05:07)
Yeah. Besides cost, were there any other evaluation criteria as you looked at other vendors?
Morgan Lee (00:05:11 - 00:05:28)
There was like kind of like more soft things. Like did it seem like we would be able to get, you know, really quick customer service? Did it seem like other people were happy with like good personal reviews from other people? I think those are the two main ones. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:28 - 00:05:36)
Yeah. And how do you think Flexport does today? What do you think its strengths and weaknesses are?
Morgan Lee (00:05:37 - 00:06:09)
Yeah, I'd say that the strengths are customer service and like being able to access someone pretty high up really quickly. And then also being able to get, if there's a problem, getting it resolved. I'd say that's like their main strength. And then the, probably the biggest weakness is they're pretty new in terms of, I mean they used to be the Shopify fulfillment network. They got brought out. They're pretty new in terms of like connecting with drop shipping programs, connecting with sps. That's been a little bit harder. I'd say that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:09 - 00:06:32)
Yeah, that Makes sense. If you don't mind, I'm going to launch a little survey here in the app. And it's just not rating shipbob, but a set of just common criteria or priorities from one to five, where I guess it's not one to five, it's not a priority to essential or. I don't know. You can let me know if you have any questions about that.
Morgan Lee (00:06:33 - 00:06:35)
Okay, let's see. It's probably trust.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:37 - 00:06:42)
High priority. Yeah, High priority.
Morgan Lee (00:06:44 - 00:06:56)
No, it's like essential. Low priority. Low priority. Low priority. Yeah. Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:58 - 00:07:26)
Awesome. Let me just take a quick look. Hey, great. Some of the clients, and you see it in, like, food items or maybe regulated industry where there's something that they're really looking for expertise from their 3 PL in that thing like shipping. Was that. Did that apply to you at all? Is there anything specific you're looking for kind of experience in, as you mentioned?
Morgan Lee (00:07:27 - 00:07:28)
No. Our stuff's pretty easy.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:28 - 00:07:39)
Yeah. If you don't mind sharing. Like, who else made it into the evaluation set for you as you looked outside of Flexport?
Morgan Lee (00:07:40 - 00:07:55)
Yeah, there was obviously Ship up. There was a company called Next Smartship. I don't know if you've heard of them. There was Ship Fusion and. Yeah, those were the three that I took calls with.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:55 - 00:07:57)
Yeah. And who did you end up going with?
Morgan Lee (00:07:58 - 00:08:00)
Um, I ended up just staying with Flexport.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:00 - 00:08:20)
Yeah, sure. Um, if you. One of my favorite questions to ask or you, like, looked at it like a race and Flexport and Shipo and the others, or the beginning of the race, do you think that any of them started out with an advantage because of reputation or maybe Flexport because of your experience with them? Like, do they have a same starting line or they have different starting lines?
Morgan Lee (00:08:20 - 00:08:27)
I'd say Flexport started way ahead just because all of our products already there and the switching costs are high for the others.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:27 - 00:08:27)
Yeah.
Morgan Lee (00:08:28 - 00:08:32)
And also just like the operational lift to kind of switch our systems over.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:32 - 00:08:32)
Yeah.
Morgan Lee (00:08:32 - 00:08:52)
So they definitely start in the lead. And then I'd say Ship Fusion and Next Smart Ship started behind shipbob. Just because I know more people that use Ship Bob. Like, I feel like they're like, probably the biggest, maybe one of the biggest 3pls or the biggest 3pl in the US and so I. Yeah, I just had a lot of good personal reviews from them.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:53 - 00:08:59)
Awesome. Well, as the race started and progressed, did any of them gain on Flexport or change positions along the way?
Morgan Lee (00:09:03 - 00:09:59)
Yeah, so. Good question. There's a couple different use cases that I was looking for. It was kind of Nuanced. So like I said, Flexport's biggest con is this lack of like customization on the wholesale fulfillment side. And so Next Smart Ship and shipbob, I felt like could have ticked both of those boxes. The reason I went with NextSmart. So I and then I ended up using some of Next smartship services for wholesale, particularly because they don't have a warehouse in the US and we could send the products to their China warehouse from our vendors and then ship it to international customers so that we don't have to pay the tariff importing it into the US and so since they could do the wholesale side of things and they could do out of country fulfillment with a warehouse, not in the US that, that was really, really helpful for us. It saved us a lot on, as I'm sure you know, a lot on tariff costs.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:59 - 00:10:00)
Yeah.
Morgan Lee (00:10:01 - 00:10:34)
And so, yeah, that was a big thing that happened. And then when with shipbob, it seemed like I was, I was pondering using them for some of like our SPS Commerce Fulfillment, but it seemed like I was worried about it being too small of a volume or not being a meaningful customer. Like for Flexport, we're a meaningful customer with our volume and so we get really high service. I was worried about having very low volume and not really be given any priority at shipbob.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:35 - 00:10:40)
Was that based on any feedback you got or just a general perception that shipbob's large?
Morgan Lee (00:10:40 - 00:10:53)
And in the, in the sales call, I got the feeling that they were more interested in getting the entire business as opposed to just that one piece that I wanted to do. And so I didn't really feel like we could talk about it very much. And that kind of made me feel that way. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:54 - 00:11:29)
Yeah. I mean, let me note that down. Awesome. I'd love to kind of expand on that. Strengths and weaknesses of, of Shipbot. What you thought they did well, sir? What do you think they did well? Like, what was a compelling thing to you?
Morgan Lee (00:11:29 - 00:12:09)
They were definitely the low cost provider. So they were, they had the cheapest rates in terms of the shipping rates were the same, but the picking rates were the cheapest out of everyone. They came in about 5 to 10 cents cheaper per item as a pick rate. So that was definitely the biggest. They definitely would have been the cheapest option. And then they also had the widest breadth of fulfillment partners, dropship providers. We do drop ship with a couple retailers and then complying with like strict SPS Commerce regular like rules from retailers, I felt like that was definitely their biggest strength.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:11 - 00:12:20)
How about weaknesses I mean, we touched on a little bit, but maybe overall things are weak and the biggest reason you did not go with them, probably.
Morgan Lee (00:12:20 - 00:12:52)
The biggest reason was it felt like I wanted to give it a try with some of the smaller pieces. And it seemed like either that wasn't like in the interest of who I was talking to. And the conversation kind of kept on going back to like, I had like this form that I was supposed to fill out for like Zone so they could give me like a really accurate pricing model. But I kind of wasn't really interested in an accurate pricing model. I knew they were going to be the cheapest anyways, and so I really wanted to know. I felt like I wasn't really getting the, the answers that I was trying to look for, I guess.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:52 - 00:12:59)
Yeah, sure. Were there answers outside of pricing you felt like you weren't getting, or were they pricing questions and you just wanted.
Morgan Lee (00:12:59 - 00:13:21)
Oh, no, yeah, I, I wasn't. I didn't really care that much about pricing. I knew they were going to be the cheapest and so I didn't really want to go through this whole process of filling out a big form just to get the answer of, I already know you guys are going to be the cheapest. It's just these other questions that I need answers to. And it felt like maybe I didn't do a great job of asking about it, but it felt like that, yeah, that wasn't getting through.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:22 - 00:13:25)
Do you mind sharing what types of questions you were trying to get to?
Morgan Lee (00:13:25 - 00:14:06)
Yeah. So I was really trying to understand how the inventory flowed between can we use the same inventory for our direct to fulfillment, can we use that same inventory and then for SPS fulfillment, and then can we still use that same inventory for drop shipping? And then if that is the case, I was really trying to get to the heart of how do we know that you're going to be prepping this SPS SKU in the correct way versus how you're prepping this directive fulfillment SKU versus how you're going to be prepping it for drop shipping. And I didn't really have a great confidence that that was going to be worked out. I felt like maybe, yeah, maybe I worded the question wrong, but yeah, yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:06 - 00:14:55)
And I have no incentive or bias on my third party. So the question is for research purposes, but like if they had or if they could come back to you and say, hey, we would value you and a senior person came in and said, hey, we value even the small part of your business. Here's the answers to those Questions. And we don't need this full, like, we can get to before the contract, the official pricing, but, like, general pricing, would that have swayed you to try them one and two, which way would you be open to them kind of giving if they came back and said no selling, just like, here's the answer to your questions, and we want that part of your business. We would value you kind of before and after. Are those. Would that have changed the output outcome?
Morgan Lee (00:14:55 - 00:15:01)
Yeah, that probably would have changed the outcome. And it probably honestly still would change the outcome now. Yeah, I'd say yes to both.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:01 - 00:15:32)
Awesome. Let me go to the next question. So within that kind of. There's feedback about sales that you just provided. Is there anything else about that sales experience that was positive or negative? Things they could learn from? Things they could. Specifically if they could learn from some competitor. Right. Things you talked to other competitors that they did exceptionally well? I'd love to hear that.
Morgan Lee (00:15:32 - 00:16:39)
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't. I felt like. I felt like maybe I got really lucky at Flexport and I just. I started off with someone a little bit higher up, but I really felt like he really understood, like, what I was trying to ask for and understood, like, the specifics of, like, what we really. What was really important to me and what was really important to the business and kind of what he felt was, like, the value add. Instead of, like, kind of listening to me and telling me, telling him what our value add was going to be and. And then, yeah, I guess kind of like it felt like he made the process. Like he, like he didn't ask. He basically didn't need anything from me to get the process rolling and to make it really seamless and to start really small and then kind of build the trust with like, um, one or two or three SKUs and then kind of scale from there. Um, that was a big difference. And it was a lot easier to start with them because they were just asking for, like, one or two SKUs. Really low risk as opposed to, like, kind of wanting the whole catalog.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:39 - 00:16:52)
Yeah, that makes total sense. Did you even get to the point at which you were sharing pricing back and forth? Or you're like, you're not listening to what I'm saying. We're not doing this.
Morgan Lee (00:16:54 - 00:17:12)
Basically, as soon as I, like, on the sales call, I was kind of like, yeah, I can try and fill out the sheet and then we'll see what the pricing looks like. But then I just. I just never got around to it. It looks very daunting when I opened it. And, yeah, look it looks hard and it looked unnecessary.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:13 - 00:17:27)
Yeah, that's really good feedback. Some of my favorite questions I say for the end are if you were the CEO or maybe CFO of Shipbob, what would you do to better serve a company like yours?
Morgan Lee (00:17:28 - 00:17:41)
Yeah, probably very similar things, as I've already said, but like be okay like starting small. Be okay like taking on a little bit of volume to like earn some trust and get started and then it can definitely scale really quickly from there.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:41 - 00:17:42)
Yeah.
Morgan Lee (00:17:42 - 00:17:58)
And then I'd also say like, like, yeah, try to, try to understand like maybe not what you think the businesses strengths are, but like try and like understand what their current problems are and then try and fix those first as opposed to going into something else.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:59 - 00:18:06)
Yeah. Is there anything I haven't asked about that when you're coming to this interview you expected to talk about?
Morgan Lee (00:18:16 - 00:18:20)
No, I don't think so. I think either you asked it or I offered it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:20 - 00:18:45)
Yeah, that's fine. It's somewhat of a. It feels like somewhat of a lazy question, but it's good to go, get to the end, ask all my questions. Hey, like, what was spurring your mind? Cool. Something we haven't talked about. It seems you're just real familiar with the space. But where did you go to learn about, you know, get referrals or to see them at an event, read content? Like what kind of influenced that original evaluation set?
Morgan Lee (00:18:46 - 00:19:13)
Yeah, I know a lot of people that use 3pls, like other business leaders, people in the, in the industry that I know a lot of it was just talking to them. They, most of them have tried multiple 3pls and kind of are really familiar. We're really familiar with like what to look out for, what not to look out for, what to ask, what to make. Make sure they're capable of doing before you start with them. Yeah, things like that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:14 - 00:19:20)
Cool. Well, I think I got what I need. I like love the shirt. I assume you vent to the event.
Morgan Lee (00:19:20 - 00:19:22)
Yeah, yeah. This is from this last year's.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:22 - 00:19:23)
That's so cool.
Morgan Lee (00:19:25 - 00:19:27)
Rare to meet someone that gets. That gets it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:28 - 00:19:29)
Yeah.
Morgan Lee (00:19:29 - 00:19:30)
I mean, how many people have called that out?
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:30 - 00:19:32)
How many, how many years have you got?
Morgan Lee (00:19:34 - 00:19:35)
I think that was my fifth year.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:36 - 00:19:37)
Are they, are they awesome?
Morgan Lee (00:19:37 - 00:19:54)
They're cool. Yeah, they're really cool. Mostly for the people you meet there. Like really great networking opportunities and just kind of very unassuming people will go up, will be there, and then like it turns out they're like the CEO of like a $500 million business and they're just like super nice to talk to. So it's a cool.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:54 - 00:20:02)
I bet if you meet someone there, someone makes the trip and they care enough to go there, there's something interesting about them that's worth learning.
Morgan Lee (00:20:02 - 00:20:04)
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good. That's a good way of saying it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:05 - 00:20:18)
Cool. Well, hey, it was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for the feedback. I'm going to share it directly to ship. Bob. I imagine when they hear some of the feedback, they may, like, say, no salespeople. They may pick a senior person to reach out and see if they could solve the problem. If that's okay with you.
Morgan Lee (00:20:18 - 00:20:25)
Yeah, yeah. Honestly, I'd love to. I'd love to. If they want to reach out and do something, I'd totally be open.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:25 - 00:20:26)
Awesome. Thanks, Maureen.
Morgan Lee (00:20:26 - 00:20:27)
Awesome. Thank you.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:27 - 00:20:27)
Bye.

It's. Hi, Drew. Hi, Drew.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:15 - 00:01:16)
Hi. How are you?
Amy Fletcher (00:01:16 - 00:01:17)
I'm good. How are you?
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:17 - 00:01:52)
Good. Thank you for making time. I have been working with Shipbob for over a year in my efforts to help them improve their business and better serve their customers and earn the business of new prospects by acting as a third party to go out and ask just questions about people's experience, evaluating them. And so if it's okay with you for the next 20, 25 minutes, I'll ask you questions about that and we'll record it, but only for private use of Shipbob. Does that all sound okay with you?
Amy Fletcher (00:01:53 - 00:01:54)
Yeah, that's fine.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:55 - 00:02:08)
Awesome. Well, just to make sure I have the context right, you're at Swanson, you recently evaluated three Pls, I believe you did not go with Shipbob, Correct?
Amy Fletcher (00:02:09 - 00:02:14)
Correct. Yep. Our conversation, I think, was back in March where we started chatting.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:14 - 00:02:25)
Okay, great. Well, can you share first kind of what you were, your current state fulfillment was, and then what triggered you to start evaluating three Pls?
Amy Fletcher (00:02:27 - 00:04:32)
I believe my. Either they reached out to us, or my counterpart, who is no longer at Swanson, had reached out to them. And then when he left in February, I took over and tried to figure out, like, what the conversations were that were being had and had a lengthy conversation with Shipton Bogle at Shipbob and have an email here from March 5th with him just like, you know, thanking us for the time to connect and all the details. And I thought that it was a great conversation and forwarded it along internally to mimic manager. And she is the Chief Transformation Officer at Swanson, to be quite frank. In March, we were in the midst of closing down one of two of our warehouses. So we had one in Pennsylvania and then the main headquarters in Fargo warehouse. And so we were closing down the Pennsylvania warehouse. It just didn't make sense, I guess, cost wise operationally anymore to have that warehouse. So that was happening in March. So I think that the timing might have not been superb for this conversation to be brought up, because everybody in operations was so focused on getting all the inventory from that warehouse pushed back to our Fargo warehouse. I, in talking with my manager on, like, phone call, brought this back up to her as well during that time, and she had referred me to send it over to our VP of ops and Director of Ops and get their buy in. And I did that, and I honestly never heard back. I think I emailed them three different times over the last couple of months about this, and they have not responded back to me. And I'm not sure if it's a. I just don't understand what you're sending me or we're not interested in it right now. And so that's, that's our fault.
Amy Fletcher (00:04:32 - 00:07:26)
That's an internal fault that I'm not hearing communication back from the team. But, um, like I even did just recently, recently reach out when I saw this invite come through a couple weeks ago of we want to chat with you and understand, I was like, hey guys, do you have anything I can provide to this company on where we're at? And I just, yeah, haven't heard anything. So I know I had mentioned, like, I can tell you what I know right now, but I don't have a lot to go off of. I think that it would be important for, for our operations team, slash my boss even to be presented what I was presented to have it go directly into their, you know, mindset of like, what actually could happen cost savings wise and sales wise. I think the company has, you know, quite frankly been one of those. This is just how we've always done IT companies. You know, Swanson's been around since 1969 and my counterpart and I had been really egging the company onto doing increased shipping speeds, you know, obviously increasing our cost to the carriers in general for our FBM orders so that we could get products to customers in a faster manner. Because in looking at the competition out there on marketplaces, we are actually like one of the slower companies to be able to deliver by the products. And it was always kind of a comment back to us of that would cost more. And we are, we're, you know, at the lowest rates for a reason. Like things are working and we don't have like insight into the under the hood of carrier conversations and costs and deals of that matter. So we have, we've been trying to increase our ship times. And so I think, yeah, again, having a direct conversation from the company to Ops plus someone on the marketing side, which would be my manager involved with marketplaces specifically, would be very helpful. I know you guys or not you, but Ship Bob would do, would be helpful for D2C and marketplaces. So obviously that's super beneficial, but I think there needs to be like a better high summary of like, here's what you guys are showing your customers right now of lead times and here's what we would do for you by being able to have all these different warehouses storing your product and like, here's the cost and here's your expected sales by showing them shorter lead times. Yeah, sorry, that was a lot of information. I thought I'd just get it all out there of everything I know.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:26 - 00:07:56)
I appreciate that. No, that's great. That's actually really useful. I'll go back and ask some questions and just learn a little bit more. But based on everything you said and very directly, what would. If shipbob came back and did that, what would it take for them to get that meeting? Is that a difficult meeting to set up for you? It sounds like responsiveness from some of those folks have been hard. But if they were ready and had all that information present exactly what you asked for, how would they go about getting that meeting?
Amy Fletcher (00:07:58 - 00:09:09)
Yeah, I would take it. I mean, I would take it to my manager again. So I haven't talked to her since she initially was like, yeah, send it over to Ops and see what they think. And then, you know, multiple conversations or forwards to them and kind of radio silence. I think I would now go back to her and be like, hey, I haven't heard from these people. And the thing is, she's going to want to know, like, why? Why should we take the time to get them involved? And to me I'd be like, well, look, here's the email change that we've been going off of, but maybe there's something that I can get that's more synthesized. The email that I'm looking at right now has, you know, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, like 10 different line item sentences. So maybe it's something a little more condensed that I can share with her, like, hey, we need to do this because it literally will improve our lead times by two, like 50%. And when that happens, sales increase by whatever percent.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:12 - 00:09:40)
Now, I heard a couple things about why do. Why you potentially even started this path to explore it. I heard one of your warehouses was shutting down. And two, I heard that there was a desire to improve lead times. And then of course, costs are always a big thing. But if you think about the criteria that are important to you, did I capture them correctly? Are there other things you think the company would kind of value or care about differently?
Amy Fletcher (00:09:45 - 00:11:49)
The. The ops team? It's clear to me that every time I have chatted with them about shipping, it's a cost thing. I think that they might like, hold. Hold value close to trust that they, you know, work diligently through making sure they're getting the best rates for services. That's their job. By all means, yes, they're doing a great job. I don't know if they've opened their minds to what other options that there are I'm not sure. That's kind of a hot feeling to me is that they're satisfied with what they've done. But so I think cost is going to be big for them just understanding that piece. But for my manager, she is the new GM of marketplaces as of fall of last year with no marketplace experience, but she's garnered a lot over the last six months. Her big thing right now is how do we increase our sales? There's. I mean, we need to be profitable too. So obviously cost again, but increasing sales. I don't personally hear a lot from anyone but myself and my previous counterpart about lead times. They need to improve those as kind of like a. It's like the stepchild of the conversation, something I'm super passionate about. Like, I understand if you're selling on marketplaces or even your D2C, like if you're not getting it, if you're not showing, you know, four or five day deliver date, I mean for D to C on marketplaces it has to be two days or three days, you know, then you're just like not going to win. They're going to buy from someone else.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:50 - 00:11:50)
Yeah.
Amy Fletcher (00:11:50 - 00:12:02)
Because people want it now. So I'd say yeah, cost and sales generation from this is going to be really big.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:03 - 00:12:15)
Yeah. So if shipbob has any data from working across all their vendors about the potential sales increase of offering faster shipping times, that could be a useful thing.
Amy Fletcher (00:12:16 - 00:12:17)
Got it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:20 - 00:12:28)
How did you find ship up? You said they may have reached out to you. I didn't remember if there's anything other, like reputational. You looked them up on Gartner or you did searches or you went to an event, anything.
Amy Fletcher (00:12:29 - 00:12:58)
Yeah, I, again, I think it was my counterpart that had started the initial conversations. I mean, I'm not sure if he had been reached out to or if he found them. There's a, there's a good potential that he actually did reach out to shipbob because we were so invested in trying to figure out how we reduce our lead times. And he was really, he was really operationally minded. So he probably did reach out to ship. Bob?
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:58 - 00:13:05)
Yeah, but yeah, it sounds like mainly an internal thing, but are there other like vendors that you're looking at also?
Amy Fletcher (00:13:08 - 00:13:21)
I know like the Amazon vehicle has reached out to us multiple times. Not sure how they directly stack up against you guys, but it's kind of in the same boat where we've gotten information. It just hasn't gone anywhere.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:21 - 00:13:21)
Sure.
Amy Fletcher (00:13:23 - 00:13:52)
And that's the only other one I would know about. I'm not sure if operations team has looked at anything else. I do know when I first brought this up to my boss though, she was actually like, oh, that would be, you know, probably a great idea. But unfortunately she just doesn't run that channel. But she has way more obviously pull. She's in the C suite than I would. So if I was able to get her or the operations team on a call, that would be more beneficial.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:52 - 00:14:14)
Yeah. If you don't mind, I'm going to launch a little survey. It's right in the Zoom app. You might see it now. And this is not about shipbob, it's just about what you value. Shipbob wants to know of these things if you think it's not a priority all the way to essential. If it's unclear to you or you're not sure, you could just mark it. I don't know. If you don't mind, I'd love if you could help me answer that.
Amy Fletcher (00:14:38 - 00:14:40)
What does headless fulfillment mean?
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:40 - 00:15:03)
I think it's the idea that when somebody places an order through a third party like a target, that it goes straight to the ship systems and orders are packaged and, and managed without you having to do much engagement or interaction with it.
Amy Fletcher (00:15:10 - 00:15:18)
I feel like I'm just not going to be the best to answer these questions. Like I know what I would. I just don't know if it would align with.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:19 - 00:15:27)
Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, I could take. I mean, we could just leave it as. I don't know and I'll. I can end the poll. That's fine.
Amy Fletcher (00:15:28 - 00:15:28)
Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:29 - 00:15:37)
Yeah, no problem. You did engage with the sales team though, correct? You had a. You got to see a presentation from them.
Amy Fletcher (00:15:37 - 00:15:45)
Yeah. With Shipton and then I had multiple conversations with or like email back and forth with a Kara.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:45 - 00:16:07)
Yeah, awesome. Well, if you don't mind, I'll ask a few questions about that. I guess. First, as you looked at the vendor for your products, is there anything industry specific you're looking to make sure that the vendor does. You think the company would really care about? Like, you know, how important is it to you that they have support other supplement companies.
Amy Fletcher (00:16:11 - 00:16:48)
Like do they have experience in other VMS companies? So then that can. I think that specifically is important. I don't. I just. Because a product is a product, it's more so like understanding the ability to ship it and. Yeah, I mean, okay, so I say that. But I also had a note, a question for you or the team of. Can you share who is using your services? Yeah, that's not necessarily to say you have to tell me that all these VMS brands are using it, but just to see what big name brands are using it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:48 - 00:17:06)
Yeah, totally. I'll let them know. They could probably follow up with that, that sales experience. What do you think? I want to hear about what didn't go well. What did go well? Just to start. What was positive from your interactions with Shipton and other team members?
Amy Fletcher (00:17:09 - 00:17:44)
I mean, I think Shipton just overall did a great job of showing us the presentation in March and following up on it multiple times. It's just kind of. It's kind of falling into one of those normal sales processes. I don't want to say normal, but it kind of is. You try and you think you're getting somewhere and then all of a sudden the brand doesn't respond. So I have nothing to say bad about what he did or that sense. I think it's just getting the right people in the room.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:46 - 00:17:54)
Yeah. What about negative? Is there anything that you think the Ship up sales teams could have done better?
Amy Fletcher (00:18:08 - 00:18:28)
Yeah, I mean nothing is again, maybe just like synthesizing it one more time like in another follow up email. Like I know you had sent out a couple of things, LinkedIn and then my email and I quite frankly didn't respond to a couple of them. And then I finally bit on the third or fourth one.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:28 - 00:18:29)
Yeah.
Amy Fletcher (00:18:29 - 00:18:34)
So maybe, maybe he needed to be a little bit more persistent and send.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:35 - 00:18:35)
Sure.
Amy Fletcher (00:18:35 - 00:18:40)
A few more follow ups with like consolidated. Just a reminder like here's what we can do for you.
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:41 - 00:18:54)
Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Did you go through getting pricing from Ship Up? Did you make it that far?
Amy Fletcher (00:18:57 - 00:20:22)
Let me get pricing. I can't remember at the moment if we did. I would assume so. Let's see here. Cost structure. I was told like the complex needs would be 25 to 30k but real package. Let's see it. Yeah. It's been a while since I've gone through this PDF of his and I'd say there's some. Oh my gosh. Excuse me. There's some areas for improvement in just the fact that this is a 38 page PowerPoint slide or PDF here.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:23 - 00:20:36)
Sure. Do you want to. Do you mind sharing your screen off the PowerPoint? Just walking through any obvious things that you wish for different or obviously more concise as a big piece of feedback. But any points that lack clarity, I'd love to hear it and see it if possible.
Amy Fletcher (00:20:37 - 00:20:43)
Well, I mean I could show it to you but I have to then sit here and read the whole thing because I haven't Read it since March.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:43 - 00:20:45)
No, you don't have to do that.
Amy Fletcher (00:20:54 - 00:20:57)
I mean. Yeah, it's just. This is just a little overwhelming when I look at it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:58 - 00:21:32)
Yeah. Like if so let's pretend we. We're going to give you one page one slide one email. What. What are the critical things you want on that you think to. To secure meaning? I mean we talked about a information about how reduced. Reduced speed or lead times can improve sales. You want evidence from other people, vendors like yourself. What else would you like to see on the email that make it easy to forward on and get a meeting? You think.
Amy Fletcher (00:21:38 - 00:21:59)
Like this. The sales that we would see from or what we're doing today versus what we would be doing with them is always what I'm asked about. Any initiative that we want to implement, it has to be what's going to be the incremental sales from that? What's the cost? What are we going to see? So what's that? Return on investment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:00 - 00:22:09)
Yep. And is all warehousing is done internally right now, right? Fulfillment and warehousing is all internal?
Amy Fletcher (00:22:12 - 00:22:26)
Yes, it's all internal and we have an agency that helps us with some marketplace stuff but we still distribute our product to them to then do some FBA stuff with.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:26 - 00:22:32)
Yeah, it sounds like they you are unable to find pricing. So maybe that you didn't get pricing yet from shipa.
Amy Fletcher (00:22:35 - 00:22:37)
On page 26. Now let's see.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:39 - 00:22:40)
Understood.
Amy Fletcher (00:22:43 - 00:22:57)
Huh. No, I don't think there. There is like a specific. Yeah. Price. I don't see anything that's specific to us.
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:57 - 00:23:32)
Okay, got it. So that pricing conversation still needs to happen. Some of my favorite questions are if you were CEO of ShipUp or had a product, is there anything that you would change to better serve a company like yours? I know it's gotten held up in some of this internal stuff and you give you more concise data but any kind of on the feature or process things you feel like the company would really benefit from. What would you recommend to Ship Bob if you were CEO for a day?
Amy Fletcher (00:23:43 - 00:23:51)
They need to become more known. I don't think that I would have known shipbob unless my counterpart had reached out to you guys.
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:53 - 00:23:55)
Are you aware of other 3 pls.
Amy Fletcher (00:23:58 - 00:24:11)
Also a great question. Yeah. No. So.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:14 - 00:24:17)
Where do you go to learn? Are you a part of any newsletters or do you go to any.
Amy Fletcher (00:24:18 - 00:24:52)
The Vico thing is because of being on Amazon and then reaching out directly. But I don't know how Ship Bob would partner with someone that's got a big voice to say unless they partnered with one of their, one of their customers. I don't know who, who's the biggest one. I do actually see a page in here that shows some of their customers and I'm not seeing any big names. I see Bloom. But.
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:55 - 00:24:58)
You said Vee Co. Is that the agency that you work with?
Amy Fletcher (00:24:59 - 00:25:09)
No, that's the Amazon Shipping Services. V, E E Q O. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:10 - 00:25:12)
And what's the agency you work with?
Amy Fletcher (00:25:14 - 00:25:15)
It's Pattern.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:16 - 00:25:24)
Pattern? Yeah, I heard about Pattern recently. And what do you use Pattern for?
Amy Fletcher (00:25:26 - 00:25:46)
They're basically acting as the distribution partner for our Amazon for Swanson branded products. But Swanson sells Swanson branded products as well as partner brand products. So we've got the whole gambit. Garden of Life, Nature made, Nature's way. Yeah, Solary. Yeah, got it.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:47 - 00:25:49)
How long have you been with Pattern?
Amy Fletcher (00:25:50 - 00:25:52)
Just a little over a year.
Drew Giovannoli (00:25:52 - 00:25:56)
Awesome. What do you think they do really well.
Amy Fletcher (00:26:00 - 00:26:51)
They have like their own tech stack. Their company is super involved in just the future futuristic everything and being first to market and their proprietary tools and understanding the advertising metrics way better than any Amazon tool could do or understanding just the product market landscape. I mean they, they sell a whole bunch of VMS brands so that is one thing that's beneficial to us. Knowing that they already have all the experience in VMs so they know. But when it comes to shipping, I just don't know if that's as important. Like to know that you shipped a vitamins product. Can you ship ours? But I don't know is important.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:00 - 00:27:08)
Well, great. Well, almost that time. Is there anything else that you'd love me to share with Ship Bob either to make your life easier or things you could learn to improve?
Amy Fletcher (00:27:17 - 00:27:20)
Do you know offhand what the main competitors are for Ship Bob?
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:23 - 00:27:48)
I mean there's a bunch of different three PL companies like a very, very long tail. Ship Bob is kind of the. Has the most. Seems to have the most warehouses and be the most tech forward of the ones that are out there. I've been mostly focused on their business though so I wouldn't be able to give you a good, good outline of the competitive marketplace.
Amy Fletcher (00:27:49 - 00:27:58)
Well, I guess that'd be you know, interesting too to just know like what, why you guys? Because our operations team might be having conversations with other ventures.
Drew Giovannoli (00:27:58 - 00:28:08)
Of course. Well, I mean thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it and responding. I'll get this information to them and hopefully they can get you back things that'll be helpful to you.
Amy Fletcher (00:28:08 - 00:28:10)
Great. Sounds good. Appreciate your time, Drew.
Drew Giovannoli (00:28:10 - 00:28:11)
Thank you Amy. Bye.

Drew Giovannoli (00:00:03 - 00:00:04)
Hi, how are you?
Matt Mundt (00:00:04 - 00:00:05)
I am good. How are you doing?
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:06 - 00:00:07)
Good. Thanks for making time today.
Matt Mundt (00:00:07 - 00:00:08)
Yeah, absolutely.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:09 - 00:00:33)
My name is Drew Giovanoli and I run started Buried Winds and we're a partner to Shipbot in that we try to help them better serve their clients and earn the business new prospects through these unbiased interviews of people who evaluated them. And so, with your permission, we'll have a 25 minute conversation about your experience and evaluation of them, your needs, and it will be used and recorded only for ship up. Is that okay with you?
Matt Mundt (00:00:34 - 00:00:35)
Yeah, yeah, that works for me.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:35 - 00:00:52)
Awesome. And I'm going to go. I can't. I can hear you. Great. I can't see you. So I'm going to go off video as well. Okay. And dig right into it just to make sure I have the context right. You're Matt Mundt, the founder and chief executive officer of Hug Sleep. Is that correct?
Matt Mundt (00:00:53 - 00:00:54)
That is correct. Yep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:54 - 00:01:01)
Awesome. And you recently evaluated 3pls, did not choose to go with shipbob, is that correct?
Matt Mundt (00:01:02 - 00:01:03)
That's correct, Yep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:03 - 00:01:16)
Great. Well, let's just start with what. How were you handling warehousing fulfillment before and what triggered and motivated you to look at three PLs in general?
Matt Mundt (00:01:18 - 00:01:32)
Yeah, we were with a partner that we just were not satisfied with. Their pricing did not match what we were originally quoted or estimated.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:32 - 00:01:32)
Sure.
Matt Mundt (00:01:32 - 00:01:38)
And there were some other issues as well, so that prompted us to look for a replacement.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:40 - 00:01:48)
Okay. And so was it mainly pricing or is there any other kind of operational process, things that you were unsatisfied with?
Matt Mundt (00:01:49 - 00:01:57)
It was. It was mainly pricing. I mean, there's always, you know, some other small things to nitpick, but for us with three PLs, it's. It's like 99 about price.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:57 - 00:02:15)
Sure. And this is tied to that. But I was gonna ask what your evaluation criteria was, so presume price is absolutely number one. Anything else that might be two through three or four, how that you valued?
Matt Mundt (00:02:17 - 00:02:37)
Yeah, I mean, they're so far down the list. But I mean, software, you know, what cadence looks like. Communication, whether it's, you know, Slack integration or through email, you know, those are all things that are positives. But you know, they could all be not available features. But if the price is correct, you know, we're going to go with that every time.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:38 - 00:02:42)
Yeah, that makes sense. Do you have access? Are you on a computer right now?
Matt Mundt (00:02:43 - 00:02:43)
I am, yep.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:43 - 00:03:36)
Great. I. If you don't mind, I'm going to launch a little poll, a survey inside of Zoom. And it's about criteria. Sorry, wrong one. Let me go back. Polls and quizzes back Shabbat launch. So understand again that price is number one. I just try to get a little bit of quantitative data too. It helps the reports and them. See, this is a list of things not about shipbot, but about 3pls in general. And it ranks from not a priority to essential. And then I don't know, you know, I think that obviously you'll, you'll have the. Let's see. Yeah, so price isn't on this. So kind of, if you don't mind just rating those other items.
Matt Mundt (00:03:39 - 00:03:54)
Got it. There you go.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:55 - 00:04:14)
Cool. Thank you so much. I. I was looking at your site before we started and well, I think that I would probably enjoy it. I think that my kids. I've got a. I've got a seven year old girl and a four year old son. I think they would have a blast with it too. Yeah, it's a cool product. How long ago did you start it?
Matt Mundt (00:04:15 - 00:04:18)
Yeah, maybe five and a half, six years ago or so.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:18 - 00:04:21)
Awesome. Well, yeah, congrats on the continued success.
Matt Mundt (00:04:21 - 00:04:23)
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it's. It's fun.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:25 - 00:04:40)
Now. It is a. It seems like a product that would be pretty standard to ship, but I would love to ask, is there anything about kind of what you're shipping or your industry that you were looking for specific industry expertise on?
Matt Mundt (00:04:41 - 00:04:45)
No, no, we're very easy client for 3pls.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:45 - 00:04:53)
Yeah, I would guess so. So how did you go about finding three PLs that you wanted to evaluate?
Matt Mundt (00:04:54 - 00:05:01)
Yeah, through Google, through Word of Mouth, through network, you know, all of that?
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:02 - 00:05:18)
Sure. And is that just texting other people, you know, emailing other people, you know, or does that include kind of any events or newsletters, any. Any other place that's kind of similar to word of Mouth, but maybe not directly person to person?
Matt Mundt (00:05:19 - 00:05:23)
No, no, it's just, you know, talking to my network. Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:24 - 00:05:32)
Great. And what vendors did you eventually choose to evaluate?
Matt Mundt (00:05:33 - 00:05:38)
I forget. You know, all of them. I can tell you who we're with now, which is wsi.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:38 - 00:05:43)
Wsi. Great. Well, what did WSI do? Do really well.
Matt Mundt (00:05:44 - 00:05:44)
Price.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:45 - 00:05:57)
Yep, that makes sense. And I'm gonna ask it, but I can presume what. Where did ship Bob fall short versus wsi?
Matt Mundt (00:05:58 - 00:06:00)
They stopped responding to my emails.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:02 - 00:06:10)
Okay. Were they in the running to win the deal before communication stopped?
Matt Mundt (00:06:12 - 00:06:35)
I don't know because they just never got me information. So I sent them over, you know, a document with a lot of data on it that they were gonna price out to see what the shipping costs would be and Again, just all comes down to the numbers of the numbers would have won. They would have got, you know, pretty big contract.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:36 - 00:06:36)
Sure.
Matt Mundt (00:06:37 - 00:06:38)
Followed up.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:39 - 00:06:55)
Yeah. So you started to engage with them. You talked about kind of their offering. It came down to hey, ship up said we need this type of information or to give you an accurate price. You went through the effort of getting them that price and then you never heard from them again, Correct?
Matt Mundt (00:06:55 - 00:07:04)
Yep. And you know, I went through multiple calls with them, which I very limited time, and then they just never responded.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:05 - 00:07:05)
Yeah.
Matt Mundt (00:07:05 - 00:07:06)
Well.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:08 - 00:07:30)
If it's worth anything, you know, the information that I learn gets passed on to the head of sales, the head of marketing, the CEO even. And so they're gonna appreciate you. She getting on the phone with me and even sharing that. So that's something they could fix because that's obviously not a. It's a terrible prospect experience.
Matt Mundt (00:07:30 - 00:07:38)
Yeah. Yeah. So you know, what are you gonna do? But yeah, we moved on.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:38 - 00:07:50)
Yeah. Makes sense. From the experience you did have with them, did you have up before they stopped responding a positive or negative sentiment about ship up?
Matt Mundt (00:07:53 - 00:07:54)
Neutral.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:55 - 00:08:23)
Neutral. Now I'm curious, you know, yes, it comes down to price. Does were you looking at, you know, where these warehouses were for. For maybe how price played into distributing to different regions or speed of delivery times at all? Or was it like truly just if you can get it there cheaper than someone else, you'll win our business?
Matt Mundt (00:08:25 - 00:08:49)
I mean, you know, shipping time does matter. There are options that we could, you know, go with currently with our current provider that would lower our price. But you know, it might take five to seven days for a customer to get it, and that's too, too long for us. But a lot of these three PLs have all converged where they're all using the same services. So it's just who's going to charge us the least amount?
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:51 - 00:09:11)
Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. WSI you, I assume, or don't even have to assume, but you heard through an appear or some word of mouth at another vendor who would use them and had a positive experience and so was worthwhile engaging.
Matt Mundt (00:09:11 - 00:09:13)
Yep, that's right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:15 - 00:09:28)
Can you recall any other vendors that were interesting to you or just at least made it to the end of the list besides Ship Bob and wsi?
Matt Mundt (00:09:28 - 00:09:38)
Yeah, there was one other one I forget it was out of New Jersey. I forget the name of it. It's been so long. But they were a very close second runner up.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:39 - 00:09:50)
Got now are you. You're using both their warehousing and fulfillment, correct?
Matt Mundt (00:09:51 - 00:09:52)
That's correct.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:54 - 00:10:15)
Let me Go to my question set, make sure I didn't miss anything. So in that sales experience or. No, let's just go back to the perception ship. Bob, did you. You said it was completely neutral. What had you heard when you got referred to Shabbat from other people? Like what. What made it even worth talking to Shabbat in the first place?
Matt Mundt (00:10:16 - 00:10:28)
I mean, the reputation isn't positive, at least from what I've heard. But they were offering free AirPods they could call. So I said, okay, AirPods.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:32 - 00:10:44)
The, the. When you say the reputation wasn't positive, is that through your direct network or just through reviews you read online or where do you learn about that? From both.
Matt Mundt (00:10:44 - 00:11:01)
Yeah. I mean, you can just, you know, type in ship Bob on X and go to DTC Twitter and see what people are saying and we have, you know, communicate with them. In the past years and years and years ago, I think maybe they got us pricing and I think I would remember it being significantly higher than what we were paying at the time.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:03 - 00:11:29)
Yeah, is. I'm new, I'm not aware of. And new to the concept of Twitter as a referral source from the interviews we've done so far, or just like a knowledge bank. What. And I will check it out. But what is going to DTC Twitter X good for? Like, what is that useful? What. What can you learn from that thread?
Matt Mundt (00:11:30 - 00:12:29)
Yeah, I mean, it's just a community of, of people that live in, you know, the world of, of D2C, whether that's operators, you know, agency founders, whatever the case may be. And, you know, everyone on the Internet's always willing to give out their 2 cents. So it's a very unfiltered take on the happenings within the community of D2C. So oftentimes people will share their, you know, unadulterated opinions. See, these are just strangers on the Internet, so you gotta take with a grain of salt. But I've also, you know, know people personally that have used ship up in the past that didn't have the greatest things to say. So it was a culmination of a lot of different sources that kind of led me to that opinion. But again, these are people that I don't know all that well. So let's take a call with them and see what they can do. And they stopped responding three months ago. Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:31 - 00:12:39)
Before they stopped responding, was it a negative, neutral or positive sales experience in learning about the business?
Matt Mundt (00:12:40 - 00:13:31)
It was neutral. You know, I had no reason to, you know, dislike them. So if they would come back, if they would respond to my emails, that would have been nice. And if they would have came back and had really good, clean, clear data and the pricing was right, we probably would have switched over to them. You know, we, we pay our current 3 PL millions of dollars a year, so they have every incentivize, every incentive to respond to my email. But, you know, I sent the email, I just pulled it up, I sent it on April 29, did not hear from them for two weeks. I sent an update to the same two people asking if there was an update. Never got a response. And that was after, you know, I think we met once or twice before. So that's, you know, probably an hour worth of my time, along with pulling all the data that they asked for, which again, was probably another hour of my time. And then they just ghosted me.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:31 - 00:13:59)
Yeah, understood. Well, I'll certainly communicate that. I want to make sure I, I, Chris, I understand this crystal clear. You said two things. If, if the pricing had been right. Right. The lowest pricing. And you said something about it the day it being like crystal clear data. Is that, is that just like a very transparent pricing model or is you thinking of something different or expecting something?
Matt Mundt (00:13:59 - 00:14:11)
Yeah, I mean, I think, I think, you know, it's just transparency across the board. Right. Whether communication style, the pricing, their promptness to respond to emails, you know, all those things are taken into consideration.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:12 - 00:15:01)
Sure, that makes sense. Let's see. Yeah, there's not too many more questions. I appreciate your time. The two questions I have left are if you were to leave WSI in nine, like, yeah, in nine months and forget about ship, but like, do you feel like your, your business is one where you kind of actively will actively look for the best prices and move to providers as opportunity presents it to you to save on margin, or you feel like you'll stick with WSI if they can deliver the right service you need at the current price?
Matt Mundt (00:15:03 - 00:15:18)
Yeah, I mean, we, we ship a lot of product, so if someone's able to come in and we're able to save, you know, 10% on average, that translates to, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we would make the switch.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:18 - 00:15:28)
Yeah, I think you could take this in a lot of ways. But if you were the CEO of Ship up, what would you change to better server company like yours?
Matt Mundt (00:15:30 - 00:15:32)
To better what? Serve a company like ours?
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:32 - 00:15:32)
Yeah.
Matt Mundt (00:15:34 - 00:15:37)
Respond to emails maybe? Top of the list.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:38 - 00:15:38)
Yeah.
Matt Mundt (00:15:40 - 00:15:59)
Yeah. I mean, it's all about price. I mean, all these exciting young three pls go out and raise a lot of money and they talk about their software no one gives a about the software. It's about the price. It's all comes down to price and reliability. All the other stuff is just distraction.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:00 - 00:16:13)
Cool. Well, Matt, thank you for your time. Yeah. Congrats on the success. Thank you. And I'll definitely explore it for my. My little ones.
Matt Mundt (00:16:14 - 00:16:18)
Awesome. Thank you. And I appreciate taking the time.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:19 - 00:16:21)
Yeah, you too. You have a great day.
Matt Mundt (00:16:21 - 00:16:22)
You too. Bye.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:22 - 00:16:22)
Bye.

Drew Giovannoli (00:00:22 - 00:00:22)
Hello.
Hieu Nguyen (00:00:24 - 00:00:25)
Hi.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:25 - 00:00:28)
Hi, how are you? This is Drew Giovannoli. Nice to meet you.
Hieu Nguyen (00:00:28 - 00:00:30)
Oh, nice to meet you too.
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:30 - 00:01:04)
Yeah, thanks for taking time today. My name is Drew Giovannoli and I run Buried Winds and we've been supporting shipbob for well over a year now in their efforts to better serve their clients and earn the business to win new prospects. And so what this is, is 20, 25 minute conversation that I'll guide you through to learn about your experience evaluating them, your needs, your pain points. They really value learning from you. And with your permission, we'll record the conversation only for use of ship Bob.
Hieu Nguyen (00:01:06 - 00:01:06)
Okay.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:07 - 00:01:08)
That work for you?
Hieu Nguyen (00:01:08 - 00:01:08)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:09 - 00:01:26)
Great. And I can hear you. I can't see you. That's totally okay. I can go off camera as well and we can just chat. Great. Well, if you don't mind, just set the context. Do you mind introducing your role in. In business?
Hieu Nguyen (00:01:30 - 00:01:44)
Yeah. So we are a. I work as a fulfillment specialist and at a e commerce company. We're looking for a fulfillment solution.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:47 - 00:01:48)
Yeah, absolutely.
Hieu Nguyen (00:01:48 - 00:01:48)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:48 - 00:01:50)
And what types of goods are you focused on?
Hieu Nguyen (00:01:51 - 00:01:55)
Like apparels, hands, jeans.
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:57 - 00:02:08)
Sure. And what triggered your evaluation? What pain point or what you run into to say, hey, we need to find, check out new 3PL providers.
Hieu Nguyen (00:02:10 - 00:02:22)
Because of the, the Trump tariff that prompt us to this diversify our logistic channel.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:24 - 00:02:30)
Yeah, that makes sense. And what, what were you using before you began your search?
Hieu Nguyen (00:02:34 - 00:02:36)
I don't think I'm comfortable sharing this.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:37 - 00:02:43)
Okay, well, can you share if it was just. If you were doing it internally by yourself or did you have another three pl?
Hieu Nguyen (00:02:43 - 00:02:47)
We have a three, another three PR that do it for us.
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:48 - 00:03:05)
Got it. And yeah, there's no need to share anything you're uncomfortable sharing. I would love to know though, what do you think they do well and what do you think what was left? Were you hoping they would improve? That kind of led you to look for more diversity.
Hieu Nguyen (00:03:07 - 00:03:25)
Because of the Trump tariff, it is pretty unprecedented. So we are looking for ways to diversify our logistics channel. Not that the current logistic partner is doing anything not good.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:27 - 00:03:33)
Got it. Okay. And what were your criteria that you were evaluating?
Hieu Nguyen (00:03:35 - 00:03:41)
The cost, the solutions and their partnership with us.
Drew Giovannoli (00:03:42 - 00:04:08)
Got it. I've got this, this poll I'd love to pull up and it just asks a question about different pillars, things that a lot of different e commerce companies look for. This is not a backstop. This is just if you could rate how important these were to you from 1 to 5 or sorry, from not a priority to essential. And if you don't Know, you can just. There's a, there's a don't know option.
Hieu Nguyen (00:04:09 - 00:04:34)
Okay. Yep. Just finish the poll.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:36 - 00:04:40)
Got it. So it was really trust and customization that were really important to you?
Hieu Nguyen (00:04:40 - 00:04:41)
Yeah, that's right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:04:42 - 00:04:46)
Can you tell me more about the customization that you needed and you wanted?
Hieu Nguyen (00:04:50 - 00:05:10)
So our. We are a startup, so we change a lot so it require. We don't require. We want to work with a partner, not just a supplier, so that we can both support each other in our in. In the field that we are in.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:12 - 00:05:17)
Yeah. Can you give me an example of something as a startup you want to be able to change quickly?
Hieu Nguyen (00:05:17 - 00:05:37)
Like we have our system in house and one of the things that we require our partner to. To do is navigate through our system and using our system fluently so that. Because we're doing everything in house and we want our partner to do that as well.
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:38 - 00:05:52)
Got it, Got it. And great. What vendors did you consider when you started? Well, even before that, how did you find out and decide what vendors you would even begin to evaluate?
Hieu Nguyen (00:05:54 - 00:05:56)
How do I find out about shipbob?
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:56 - 00:05:59)
You mean Ship Bob and just any other vendors you considered?
Hieu Nguyen (00:06:01 - 00:06:06)
We do like Google search and a few names pops up.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:08 - 00:06:09)
Okay.
Hieu Nguyen (00:06:09 - 00:06:11)
And shipbob was one of them.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:11 - 00:06:20)
Who did you start engaging with? Who? Yeah, what, what. What vendors have you. Did you begin to evaluate.
Hieu Nguyen (00:06:22 - 00:06:31)
Shipbob and other vendors? We did a lot, but we finally came to a decision.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:33 - 00:06:35)
Oh great. Who did you go with?
Hieu Nguyen (00:06:38 - 00:06:42)
This is confidential, so I'm not ready to share that.
Drew Giovannoli (00:06:43 - 00:06:48)
Okay. Can you tell me what that company did exceptionally well that earned your trust?
Hieu Nguyen (00:06:49 - 00:07:02)
Like customizations? Like I said, I just explained to you we are able to demand what we want from them to help us achieve our growth.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:05 - 00:07:08)
Can you give more details on what you're demanding of them?
Hieu Nguyen (00:07:10 - 00:07:25)
Like I said, one of the simple things that I can tell you is that them navigate using our ERP system so that everything we do is in house.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:28 - 00:07:33)
Yeah. Okay. So an ERP system integration was really important to you.
Hieu Nguyen (00:07:34 - 00:07:35)
Yep, that's right.
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:36 - 00:07:53)
Cool. And let's talk about chipbot for a little bit. I'd love to know what you think they did well and areas you think that they were weak in. Ultimately you didn't go with Ship Bob, so I'd love to hear what were their biggest kind of weaknesses in your mind.
Hieu Nguyen (00:07:55 - 00:08:18)
One of the things that we do is like the we we. They don't have a. A. They only offer fulfillment solutions, not freight solution as well. So that one of the important things that we look for when Doing our search.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:20 - 00:08:23)
Okay, so freight solutions were really important to you?
Hieu Nguyen (00:08:25 - 00:08:32)
Not the freight solution is important, but we're looking for a partner that can have all round expertise.
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:35 - 00:08:49)
Got it. Was there anything about Shipbob that you thought was really valuable? What, like what do you, what do you think their strengths were? If you were to tell someone else who's considering Ship up and they're asking your advice?
Hieu Nguyen (00:08:50 - 00:09:04)
I guess it's their, their fulfillment services. They did a lot of. They have a lot of partners, big partners.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:10 - 00:09:14)
What kind of partners did you value? Well, like what, what types of partners you talking about?
Hieu Nguyen (00:09:16 - 00:09:31)
From the website, there's a lot of like big brands, like I'm not sure, but a lot of big brands that they are showing on their website that shows that they are a reliable company.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:34 - 00:09:40)
Got it. So you felt like they had trust, you had trust because of the people who they had as clients.
Hieu Nguyen (00:09:41 - 00:09:41)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:09:45 - 00:10:07)
Great. Let's talk about your, your products. Did you feel like, is there anything specific you're looking for in the vendor that was industry specific in dealing with your, your products? Were you looking for a 3 PL who could handle apparel in a certain way? Her clients like you?
Hieu Nguyen (00:10:09 - 00:10:28)
Like I said, we are looking for a partner, not necessarily a supplier or a 3 PL partner that can support us like overall and sometimes can do like ad hoc requirement from outside because we change it a lot.
Drew Giovannoli (00:10:32 - 00:11:20)
Got it. So just my goal in this conversation is to pay you for your time in order to learn things that shipbob can improve upon. Right. They. They want to get better. And so what I need to look for is. Yeah, just information on areas you. You experience with Shipbub, things that they can improve upon, things about the competition that you could, they could learn from. Just any of those types of things would be, would be really, really valuable for me. So does anything come to mind knowing that my goal is to learn for chipbob that you think Ship up could improve upon.
Hieu Nguyen (00:11:24 - 00:11:55)
This is not something that we were originally looking at. It's just a, an options that we. That allow us to choose when. If the Trump tariff were to be tougher than tougher, like what he originally intended it to be. Does that make sense? Like we want to lay out all the options that we have and make decision from there.
Drew Giovannoli (00:11:56 - 00:12:04)
Sure. Now I think you mentioned it was a croissant. Is that the name of the company? Croissant. Croissant, yeah.
Hieu Nguyen (00:12:04 - 00:12:05)
Yeah.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:06 - 00:12:19)
Was an apparel company. When I go to croissant.com where do I see kind of the apparel stuff? Is it more of a platform than a E commerce company.
Hieu Nguyen (00:12:20 - 00:12:23)
We do both a platform and an E commerce.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:26 - 00:12:33)
If I was to look for your e commerce site, where could I find your products?
Hieu Nguyen (00:12:36 - 00:12:44)
You can search Stretch Active on. Yeah and it will pop up.
Drew Giovannoli (00:12:54 - 00:13:17)
Let's see stretchactive.com. got it. Got it. And so Tommy, I'd love to learn more. It seems like you have that apparel brand and then you have this software side of the business as well. Tell me about what Crosscion does on the software side.
Hieu Nguyen (00:13:19 - 00:13:28)
We have the ERP in house as well. So that's the ERP that I told you about that we want our partner to navigate on.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:32 - 00:13:39)
Yeah, that makes sense. And so does your. Tell me about the software. Are you helping serve other e commerce brands as well?
Hieu Nguyen (00:13:40 - 00:13:46)
Only our brands. We. The software is only for our use only.
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:48 - 00:14:33)
Got it. Well, I see the description. It says leading and leveling the playing field for cross bought border E Commerce. Awesome. And you were looking for an alternative as. Or just increase your options as the Trump tariffs came into effect or there was lack clarity around them or was this just to find people like with different costs you said in different locations and distribution centers.
Hieu Nguyen (00:14:36 - 00:14:56)
We don't look at distribution center as much as the. The. The competitive of the quotation. So we value like better price and customization from our partners. Yeah, not like, not locations.
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:57 - 00:15:02)
Okay. Did you speak with the Shipab sales team at all?
Hieu Nguyen (00:15:03 - 00:15:06)
Yeah, we, we. We did talk with them a few times.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:07 - 00:15:17)
Great. I'd love to hear about that experience. How did it. What. What did that sales team do? Well and I'll ask of course where they could improve. But what did you. How did you find that experience?
Hieu Nguyen (00:15:19 - 00:15:48)
I think talking with Nick is very. He understands our business like right away. So he was able to offer us the quotation right away which is what we are looking for so that we can level. We can make the decision and comparing between each. Each of our partners easily.
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:51 - 00:16:02)
Okay, so he gave you what you needed to compare. That's correct. And was he responsive? Did you guys get to talk about pricing at all?
Hieu Nguyen (00:16:04 - 00:16:24)
Yeah, our goal there was only to get a quotation and hear about shipbob solution for our business. And I think from what we need this is we get what we needed from the sales team of Shipbox.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:25 - 00:16:32)
Great. Well, where do you think they could have improved? Is there anything that you wish you would have learned or heard from them or experience that would have been different?
Hieu Nguyen (00:16:35 - 00:16:36)
Nope, I don't think so.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:40 - 00:16:43)
Did you. Did you end up getting pricing from ship up?
Hieu Nguyen (00:16:44 - 00:16:45)
Yeah, we did.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:46 - 00:16:48)
And how long did that process take?
Hieu Nguyen (00:16:50 - 00:16:53)
Like five Days to a week.
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:55 - 00:16:57)
Okay. And did that match your expectations?
Hieu Nguyen (00:17:02 - 00:17:18)
I think it is in line with our expectation. But again we are looking for a partners and someone who we can ask for to do like ad hoc and customizations to the solutions.
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:21 - 00:17:58)
Yeah, you're. You said a lot about customizations and you're. Because you're a startup, a lot of change your requirements man. But what's still not clear to me what the you know, customizations are are these like your packaging changes. You're putting specific notes in it. You need to go different places. Like do you mind pretend like I'm pretend I'm totally new and. And stupid to the. The whole idea. I really appreciate if you could kind of break down the things that you care about customizing a little bit more.
Hieu Nguyen (00:18:01 - 00:19:22)
So for example, we would. We have a lot of SKU and we would require the. The suppliers to be able to distinguish between them seamlessly. Even though they look alike. They look almost alike between each other. That's one thing. And secondly is the packaging. Our products are very. Some of them have magnets. So putting so and packaging magnets product can be a little different. That as well. And other thing is sometimes we have a. A lot of customizations. Like if we change something in our operations, we will educate our partners so that they can also accommodate our requirement as well. I can't think of any specific example right now, but that's the two that I can think of at the moment.
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:25 - 00:19:35)
Okay, great. And did you feel like shipbob was weak in those customizations.
Hieu Nguyen (00:19:39 - 00:20:09)
Again? We didn't talk about it with them. It's just that we Shipbox give us a lot of information and that is very helpful for us to. To lay out all the options that we have and to decide what to what to make the decision on when time is tough, when Trump initiate the tariff.
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:11 - 00:20:15)
Okay. Well Hugh, thank you for your time today. I hope you have a great day.
