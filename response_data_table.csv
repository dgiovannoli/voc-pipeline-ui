BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_1,"I was prompted to evaluate Rev because I needed a tool this. As a solo practitioner at my law firm, efficiency and accuracy are paramount in my work. Before using Rev, I struggled with time-consuming transcription tasks that often led to errors and delays in my legal documentation.

BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_4_1,"I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.",Enhanced AI Feature for Legal Transcription and Analysis,How do you use Rev today and what specific triggers or keywords do you look for?,closed won,Buried Wins,Leila Vaez-Iravani,01/15/2024,"Positive feedback on Rev's AI feature for legal transcription and analysis, highlighting the ability to quickly navigate to specific points in recordings and the usefulness of AI-generated bullet points for summarization and understanding complex legal content.","Improved efficiency in reviewing and analyzing legal content, potential for further customization of AI features for legal terms and specific search criteria.","Smooth integration of Rev's AI feature into legal workflow, enhancing the speed and accuracy of content analysis.","Minimal risks identified, with potential suggestions for further AI customization to align with specific legal requirements.","Rev's AI feature stands out for its ability to assist legal professionals in efficiently navigating and summarizing large volumes of content, offering a competitive edge in content analysis and case preparation.","Key success factors include the AI feature's ease of use, time-saving benefits, and potential for customization to meet specific legal needs.","Positive feedback on Rev's AI feature, with suggestions for future enhancements to tailor the tool for legal professionals' specific requirements.","High satisfaction with Rev's service quality, particularly regarding the AI feature's performance in legal transcription and content analysis.","The decision to use Rev was driven by the need for a more efficient and cost-effective transcription solution, with the AI feature proving instrumental in enhancing legal content analysis.","Previous challenges with traditional transcription services, such as delays and high costs, were effectively addressed by Rev's AI feature, improving workflow efficiency and content accessibility.","Success metrics include time saved in content analysis, improved accuracy in legal transcription, and enhanced understanding of complex legal content through AI-generated summaries.","Future plans involve further exploring Rev's AI capabilities for legal applications, potentially customizing the tool to align with specific legal terminology and search criteria."

BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_5_1,"Yeah, I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind? Things that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing. Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for.

BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_6_1,"Really good question. I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many.

To an extent. When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case. However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence. Totally. That makes sense.

I did notice last time there's quite a few errors I think that I didn't do the human, I think there's one that you can get humans to look it over. I think they just need to crisp it up a little bit. Voice recognition technology or whatever they use. There was a quite a bit of error. Also the distinction between speakers. Sometimes there was two speakers. I thought there was three. again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is.
