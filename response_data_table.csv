"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff.","Product Features","What prompted you to

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","It's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star.","Product Features","How do you use Rev's transcription service?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila V

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? So look around, do you mind? Things like that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. So certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, so punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered.","Product Features","How can the product be improved?","Closed Won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025"

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_2","I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many.","Pain Points","What challenges did you face?","Closed Won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","To an extent? To an extent it's one of those, yes, to an extent. When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case.","Pain Points","How do you approach different types of cases?","Closed Won","Law Offices of

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","I did notice last time there's quite a few errors I think that I didn't do the human, I think there's one that you can get humans to look it over. I think they just need to crisp it up a little bit. Voice recognition technology or whatever they use. There was a quite a bit of error. Also the distinction between speakers. Sometimes there was two speakers. I thought there was three. So again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. So voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, like something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just so I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","I don't. Cleo try to get me pretty hard. My caseload isn't big enough really now for me to do that. And I like a hands on approach. I've Dropbox for all my files, but I also actually have paper files still. It's helpful for me to visualize and see, and I like taking them into court so I don't have the laptop out and I'm a little bit more hands-on like that. Again, I'm a solo practitioner. If I started to take on staff, then I think that it would be inevitable. I'd have to jump over to something like that. I know Cleo is well used or widely used and generally liked by my colleagues.","Product Features","Do you use any other tools like a case management tool or any other software for your practice?","Closed Won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025"

"Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_1","I think so. Interesting question because there's definitely benefits of both not having to deal, especially since I don't have a paralegal or administration. Administration at all. I would say that the downside is that it's more paperwork. So I say I pass it along and then immediate thought was, have I actually though because am I keeping good enough track of all of my costs? Or is it if a transcript is five bucks, let's say it is more expensive for me to go and track it all than it is, just let that go. So that's one thing to consider. So that part of it is annoying. Also, if it's a subscription, you can write it off on your taxes and you don't have to continually, it's just done. So I think it should be an option.","Pricing","What are the benefits and downsides of using Rev?","Closed Won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/202
