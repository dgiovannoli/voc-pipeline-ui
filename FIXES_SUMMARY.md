# üîß Fixes Applied Summary

## **üìä Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **1. Pricing Tab - No Data Issue**

#### **Problem:**
- Pricing Analysis tab was empty despite having pricing-related themes
- Filter was too restrictive, only checking theme statements
- Missing pricing keywords in the filter

#### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Enhanced Pricing Keywords**: Added more comprehensive pricing terms:
   - Added: `money`, `dollar`, `paid`, `pay`, `charge`, `fee`, `rate`, `costly`
   - Added: `economical`, `financial`, `monetary`, `economic`, `fiscal`

2. **Quote-Level Analysis**: Now checks individual quotes for pricing content:
   ```python
   # Also check quotes for pricing content
   quotes = theme.get('all_quotes', [])
   has_pricing_quotes = False
   for quote in quotes:
       quote_text = quote.get('verbatim_response', '').lower()
       if any(keyword in quote_text for keyword in pricing_keywords):
           has_pricing_quotes = True
           break
   ```

3. **Inclusive Filtering**: Include themes if ANY criteria match:
   - Theme statement contains pricing keywords
   - Subject is pricing/commercial related
   - Any quote contains pricing keywords

### **2. Research Question Coverage Issue**

#### **Problem:**
- Questions 8 & 9 (strengths/weaknesses vs competitors) showed as "uncovered"
- Simple keyword matching wasn't recognizing theme types
- Threshold was too high (30% ‚Üí 20%)

#### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Enhanced Question-Theme Alignment Logic**:
   ```python
   def _check_question_theme_alignment(self, question: str, theme_text: str, theme_type: str) -> List[str]:
       # Handle strengths vs competitors question
       if 'strengths' in question and 'versus' in question and 'companies' in question:
           if theme_type == 'strength' and any(word in theme_text for word in ['competitor', 'competition', 'versus', 'compared', 'alternative']):
               matches.extend(['strength', 'competitive'])
           elif theme_type == 'strength':
               matches.append('strength')
       
       # Handle weaknesses vs competitors question
       elif 'weaknesses' in question and 'versus' in question and 'companies' in question:
           if theme_type == 'weakness' and any(word in theme_text for word in ['competitor', 'competition', 'versus', 'compared', 'alternative']):
               matches.extend(['weakness', 'competitive'])
           elif theme_type == 'weakness':
               matches.append('weakness')
   ```

2. **Lowered Coverage Threshold**: From 30% to 20% for better coverage

3. **Theme Type Recognition**: Now considers theme type (strength/weakness) when mapping to research questions

## **üìà Expected Results**

### **Pricing Tab:**
- Should now show pricing-related themes from:
  - "Pricing and Commercial" subject area
  - Themes with pricing keywords in statements
  - Themes with pricing content in quotes
  - Competitive pricing themes

### **Research Question Coverage:**
- Questions 8 & 9 should now show as "covered"
- Strength themes should map to Question 8
- Weakness themes should map to Question 9
- Competitive themes should map to both questions

## **üîç Verification Steps**

1. **Check Pricing Tab**: Open `fixed_enhanced_workbook.xlsx` and verify:
   - Pricing Analysis tab has data
   - Pricing themes are properly categorized
   - Competitive context is extracted

2. **Check Research Coverage**: Look at:
   - Discussion Guide Coverage tab
   - Research Question Alignment tab
   - Verify Questions 8 & 9 show as covered

## **üìä Files Updated**

- **`excel_win_loss_exporter.py`**:
  - Enhanced `_filter_themes_by_pricing_focus()` method
  - Added `_check_question_theme_alignment()` method
  - Improved `_analyze_theme_question_coverage()` method

## **üéØ Next Steps**

1. **Review the fixed workbook** to confirm both issues are resolved
2. **Test with different client data** to ensure fixes work broadly
3. **Consider additional enhancements** based on the review
