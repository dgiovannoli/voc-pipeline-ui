Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_1,"So I mainly use it for depositions. I've recorded a couple hearings, but my main thing was with court reporters. Sometimes the standard turnaround on a transcript is a week or two or three, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in rush fees. So I would like to have a transcript, even though it might not be a hundred percent perfect, just something that I can refer to, or also to have something to refer to in real time. If there's multiple parties and there's a lot of crosstalk going on, or if opposing counsel objects to something and cites case law or I don't know, vehicle code section, and I miss it, I want to just be able to look up and say, oh yeah, it was 1 46 0.5 or something like that. And then I can look it up to see what they're talking about, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So I started with the, let me see, what was the name of the company? It'll come to me, but it was also one of those online recording and transcription websites. And that one I got frustrated with because it was so inaccurate. I would spend hours listening to the audio and retyping basically pretty much everything. So then I thought, there's got to be a better solution, but it's got to be something more accurate. And then I came across Rev, and Rev portrayed itself as more geared towards legal field rather than just general recording. So I thought, Hey, that's perfect. And with the amount of depositions I do, I wanted something that gives me unlimited recording time or something that doesn't cut me off after 30 minutes, like the basic Zoom. So that's why I decided to pay for the higher package that gives me X 20 minutes well within what I need. So that's perfect. And I also like that it comes, unlike the previous one, which I'll remember, I was able to download the app and use it on my iPad. So I would have my laptop, just like I have it with you. I would have my iPad right next to me and I would be running the Rev app, and I can just look over on my screen and see it going on line by line. So I really like that. But I would say my biggest issue and something that's been happening every single time, whenever we go on break and I hit pause, and then we come back from a break and I resume, it starts writing me an essay. It doesn't separate it anymore. And that happens for the rest of the recording, unless I hit stop and upload it. And then when the upload comes back, then it separated speaker one, speaker two. But no matter how many times I hit the pause or presume after the first pause, it starts blocking it. And sometimes it could take an hour and then suddenly it changes the mind and it starts breaking it up again. Sometimes it can take 10 minutes or till the end of the deposition. That's one thing that's been bugging me consistently when I hit pause and resume, it just stops chopping it up. So I think that's,",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,How have you used Rev so far?,closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_2,"I have not. I mean, I've used the summarization for the transcript to give me to find specific keywords or find specific sections of within the recording. Other than that, I haven't really explored other AI functions outside of that, which is on my to-do list when I get to it.",Integration Requirements,Now file VIN has some AI capabilities or have you used file vin's AI capabilities?

Unknown_Alex Vandenberg_1_3,"I mean, mainly just Word and PDF if I'm trying to edit stuff. Other than that, I can't really think of other formatting that would help me in my daily work. Yeah, I can't think of one right now.",Integration Requirements,"In terms of the world of keeping things legal specific, are there any other areas you think they could improve to make it more legal centric, either integrations with other software, certain formatting that you need, anything like that?",closed_won,Unknown,Alex Vandenberg,2024-01-01
