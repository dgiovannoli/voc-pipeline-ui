    "verbatim_response": "In the legal world when you have mass torts and you have so many people, so many claimants and you have to call each one, go through the questions to see what they qualified. Those type of transcripts are a lot easier than going back to the calls. And if you're familiar with, like the Johnson and Johnson Talcum Powder Mass tort, or if you've seen, like the Camp Lejeune commercials, you can have a thousand plus potential claimants that you have to have calls that you're just calling them. But we have the audio, but we don't have the transcripts. And then when you go through all their documents and it comes, the other side would pick out a few potential claimants that they want to do further depositions on. You want to go back to those calls again. You don't want to listen to it. So going when it qualifies to the second round using your service was a very big help in just having that file and preparing the attorneys so they don't have to listen to the call. They can just read what the call had, and if they had any questions, they were ready for depositions. So if you really want to know the space now that would be probably give you the best client base. I would look into the mass tort space.",
