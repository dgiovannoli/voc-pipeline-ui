An Interview with Cathy Rafael, Firm Administrator at Ventura Law
Transcript
Drew: How did you come across Supio in the first place?
Cathy: The CEOâ€”I honestly don't know how he met them. I don't know if they were at a convention and they were seeking investors. We spoke with them a few years ago. We vetted whether or not to invest and I think at the time we ultimately decided not to and then we lost touch. We've been tailing them for a few years. We just haven't committed yet.
Drew: What events or conferences does your firm value the most?
Cathy: The mass tort conferences to keep up with the ever evolving mass tort world and technology too. And we also attend Legal Week in New York City. We need to keep up on technology and stay ahead in the legal world.
Drew: You've been tracking them for a couple years. How would you describe the pain point and how important that is to solve?
Cathy: Originally we looked to partner with them and help invest in the company to grow it. We didn't do that. It required a huge investment. We weren't sure or confident that it was a good investment because there was a lot of competition in this area. There were a lot of companies vetting and investing in the growth of this kind of software, and so we didn't do it. And then they vetted us a couple of times as the software technology started to develop and get better. We tested it a few times and we just felt like it wasn't there yet. Key part of it was actually the integration, making sure that we could integrate it with the case management software that we had. And so it's actually one of the biggest reasons, well, one of the reasons, not the only reason why we haven't invested in the software yet.
Drew: What are the other key reasons?
Cathy: Cost. It would cost me more than the case management software that we use.
Drew: Which case management software do you use and when did you last evaluate it?
Cathy: We evaluate every couple of months. I've received follow-up recently. I don't remember who sent a follow up to be honest with you. They kind of sent different people to follow up, but we do check in every couple of months to see how their progress is and if the cost has gone down. The other thing that we are doing, Neos has its own version of AI, and so we've bitten into that for other reasons, not because its technology is great, but because we needed to bundle in some other technology costs for Neos and that came with Neos AI and so now I'm trying to encourage my staff to use it. I could see if they're going to utilize it, then it may justify buying the fancier version, but I haven't been able to get our staff to buy in. I've got two employees out of 60 using the AI software.
Drew: Why do you think there are adoption challenges?
Cathy: I think that people are at their own speed when they work on a file and the caseloads that they have, and some are resistant to change and technology, they don't need it. They don't want it. Others, it's just a matter of learning how to use it and trust it. I think the trust is a huge issue with AI technology, understanding that the information coming out of the technology is reliable and it is time learning curve, learning how to use this new technology and not allowing it to slow you down.
Drew: Regarding the integration, what exactly was the problem?
Cathy: Not having to transfer data to another software, allowing them to connect directly to the information that's already in the case management. So right now you would have to take your SharePoint file and upload it to Supio and then do what you got to do with it. Being able to just quickly post or copy the information to a case, extract data. So Neos AI right now allows you to extract information and add parties from it, copy into the records and value tab. You can insert a bill and it'll extract the totals and put it into the value tab automatically.
Drew: Are there any other nice-to-haves you'd like to see?
Cathy: There's things about Supio that I really love and there's things that I think they're a little behind on, but it's not necessarily behind. I think that it would be hard because every firm is so different for us. We have a lot of documents that are coded and set up, so being able to work with the already existing templates would be key.
Drew: What do you think they do well and where are they behind?
Cathy: You can use any record and it automatically audits and considers anything in the file. So that is awesome that there's no limitation. NEOS has a limitation and you have to actually select every single time that you want to ask a question. You have to select the files that you want to audit and review. So I love that Supio is more like Chat GPT. The data exists in a folder somewhere, they're going to audit it. I wish that it would be easier to program and code so that I could say, I want to set up this demand letter to extract this information automatically and generate that as we work on it. Whereas I believe what I experienced in the last trial with Supio, you have to generate that document every time. It can't just continuously increase or add to the existing document. It should be like an evolving summary.
Every program I've vetted is requiring you to upload data. They have limitations on how much data you can upload and then you have to extract the information, copy it into the tab. It's a lot more work. And for the type of work that we're doing right now in personal injury, I can't justify that. If it was complex litigation and I'm like, here's 5,000 pages of records, summarize, find me the injury, it would be worth the investment. Doing hundreds of files and compared to volume, I can't justify the cost for the amount of productivity that we have right now.
Drew: If you had this technology for complex litigation, how would it have helped?
Cathy: I used to handle the Mass torts department many years ago. I was the senior paralegal in the department and I reviewed hundreds of files a week. If I had this technology when I was managing mass torts, I could have managed way more files and I was already managing hundreds of files at the time I invested in OCR technology. So we were looking for key terms and that was the best that you could have at the time. If I had anything like Supio or a Chat GPT to help me summarize records or quickly find the information I was looking for, I can't even tell you the amount of volume I would've been able to handle.
Drew: Regarding price, is it just that the number is too high or is it about the pricing structure?
Cathy: It's the commitment to the package. So you have to commit to doing volume, and I don't think I can get there. I would almost rather it be charged either a flat rate per user or per case or as you use it. So you have this technology and feature available to you, so if they generate something from the system, then you charge me for it.
Drew: Is that tied to the adoption problem you see with AI and Neos?
Cathy: Yeah, that's truly why I haven't done it because one, I would have to commit to the usage and I don't have enough people committed to using the software to commit to the usage. I'm saying you have to do 20 to 30 a month or they're going to charge you for volume and I don't have enough people adopting this crappy version of AI to justify locking in a six figure cost. I calculated it would be around $106,000 a year to start, and if it got really popular and caught on, then it could be way more. And how do I recover the cost for that?
Drew: Would it be accurate to say that if it was not a committed price, but a pure per usage per case price in arrears, it would be something you'd be using today?
Cathy: Yeah, I think that if they could allow us to do an introductory commitment, pay as you go kind of thing, that we would be assets and we're great at feedback and meeting with people to provide constructive feedback. The challenges I would see are doing all the work to implement Supio into our system. So I'm dedicating manpower to an already strained IT department because as we evolve and grow into so much technology, it's more hands on deck for my IT team. So when I think of the reason why we haven't really pushed forward with Supio ultimately too is because when I think of all the technology advances that I need to make with the firm, I can't distract my IT team with supporting Supio and it's going to be, if I spend $106,000 a year, it's important that we prioritize supporting Supio. So then I'm forcing my strained IT team to support an expensive program, spend more time helping our staff, our tech handicap staff utilizing the software.
The only other benefit I do see is that if I were to take it on right now with the limited litigation staff that I have and how hard it is to get reliable, good help, this could help speed up their work process. So if it could generate documents summarizing the records and answering the questions, it could be hiring another employee. But we haven't been able to dedicate the time and to lock in that cost to even try doing that is just what's holding us back.
Drew: What competitor do you consider the closest in value?
Cathy: I don't know that I've identified a competitor in what they're doing because everyone that we've vetted with this kind of technology doesn't really stand a chance against them. But I do think that they're lacking case management software. So I think that if Supio was its own product with case management software would be even more phenomenal. It's an all in one package. I think that the only competitor I would probably say could put them to the curve quickly is FY, because I think FY is stepping up their game, but I think they partner with FY, so I don't know what they're doing if they're working on integration with them. I think that's the only other thing that could really make them stand out against the competitor is to either align themselves with the case management software or create their own.
Drew: If Supio created their own case management software or partnered with another one that wasn't Neos, would it be worth switching?
Cathy: A couple things go into this. Again, cost. There's a reason why we haven't gotten Solidify is the cost of FY. The other thing that we don't like about Solidify is that they own the data management part of it. It's very costly to get into their software and technology that manages the data. And if you were to ever want to leave, it costs you even more to extract it. So we don't like not owning our own data and being able to manage our software.
We're a longstanding law firm. We've been around for over 65 years. Most of our employees have worked for us an average of 10 years or more. And I'm talking, we have more people that have worked 15 to 20 years. So the mentality don't fix it if it ain't broke. And they work really well within the technology that they currently have. Microsoft products, Excel spreadsheets, they're still very much of a paper mindset. So over the last five to 10 years, we've been forcing them to adopt more technology and make changes to go paperless. Texting was a huge adjustment. So when I invest in software, I have to keep in mind that I have some pretty stubborn employees who are not going to adopt the software and I have to find my influencers to kind of push it out there.
Right now I have my influencers working on Neos AI and telling people at the monthly help desks how great the software is. And I keep telling them, this software is good, but it's not great. And I have great software that I can purchase to make your lives easier and blow your mind. But I will not invest in the money. I can't affect our bottom line for two people.
Drew: If you were the CEO of Supio, what would you prioritize to better serve someone like Ventura Law?
Cathy: You have to come up with a business game plan for people who can't afford Supio. It's like buying a cell phone and you get locked in for two years because they're giving you a free phone. You've gained business for two years. So over time, even with Neos, they locked us in at a phenomenal rate. I think it was like 70 bucks a user or 60 some crazy number for three years, and now we're in the hundreds and hundred 25 range. We keep adding, we keep buying in to their programs and software because people have adopted productivity is increased. We can see the value in some of the features and we pay for it. Texting went from a few thousand a year to 10,000 a quarter, we have to buy in beyond their top tier of texting. So that's just an example of if they would give us an entry level offer.
Drew: Is there anything I haven't asked you about that I should have?
Cathy: I think they lack confidence. They have a great product. I don't know what the backend is or how they're spending their money to support this product, but if the cost is reflective of that, how many people they need to support it or how expensive it is to maintain that, they need to figure that out. They need to trim the fat because I think they'll only continue to grow if they can make it affordable for companies like us.

An Interview with Lisa Benson, Legal Assistant at DeVaughn James
Lisa Benson: Yes. So kind of rolling it out.
Drew Giovannoli: And how long have you been at DeVaughn James?
Lisa Benson: 10 years.
Drew Giovannoli: What prompted your company to evaluate solutions like Supio?
Lisa Benson: One of our partners did come about it at an event where I believe the owner of Supio was there and they came in contact with him. But we are always looking for ways to streamline things, make processes more efficient. And we have in the past tried out several different companies that would write demands for us. So didn't necessarily include the AI aspect of Supio, but we would sometimes use companies that we would contract out to just write a demand for a case. And so that is one of the things that Supio does. But then also when one of the partners came in contact, learned more about Supio, he was very excited about the prospects and then I was involved in meeting with them also some of the early meetings when they were deciding if it was something they wanted to go forward with.
Drew Giovannoli: What specifically was exciting to him about it?
Lisa Benson: I think he liked the idea of just making things a lot more efficient, being able to, one of the things that really can slow down a case, so we're kind of in personal injury, you're waiting until the client is done treating, and so that can take a while. And then that's when you collect all the medical records and things. And that's a very long process is getting all that in and then evaluating all that. And so having a tool like Supio that could do that quickly and help find missing bills and records, things that are missing. And then I think one of the things that, well, so it's also been a struggle for us to maintain legal assistance, hire and train new legal assistants and keep them. And those are the ones that in our firm that are typically writing the demand. So being able to produce demands I think was the first thing that got us interested in Supio and being able to utilize AI to do that super efficiently and to be able to get feedback about medical records, to be able to just dive into that massive information better.
But then once we were meeting with them, one of the things we really realized too is it was going to be super beneficial for the litigation side when we needed to access, if they're in a deposition and they needed to access information on a case very quickly and to be able to say, well, you said here in this recorded statement or in this deposition, this thing, why are you contradicting yourself now? To be able to have that at your fingertips, to be able to help create actual legal documents for filings, they realized that that was also going to be especially beneficial for our litigation side too, not just the demand writing part of it.
Drew Giovannoli: Who was involved in evaluating this tool?
Lisa Benson: It was the three partners of our firm. They were involved and then the office manager who is very involved in just overseeing all processes and production, and I believe our head of HR, which sounds kind of funny, but she also kind of has one of those, a lot of internal firm knowledge. And so they valued her opinion and I believe she was on in there. And then we also had somebody who is in our technology role who she's, her role is really with our software that we use and maintaining that. And so she was involved as well to get that technological kind of insight. And then myself who does special projects. Wait, I take that back. The HR, the head of HR, she was not involved in that now that I think about it. So it was the office manager, the three partners, and then someone who kind of oversees our technological side internally, not our IT team, but someone who deals with our software.
Drew Giovannoli: Was it one of the partners who really picked it and chose it and drove the purchase?
Lisa Benson: Yeah, it was Dustin DeVaughn, the partner who like you said, championed it. I mean, everybody was in agreeance, but I think they were kind of like, oh, we don't really know what this AI is exactly. It sounds good. But he was the one who really championed it and he was the one who had the contact with the Supio representative. I think it was the owner of Supio, if I am right, or at least somebody very high up in Supio that Dustin met with. And so he was the one who really championed it.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you look at any other competitors?
Lisa Benson: We had priced out competitors in the demand writing aspect. Again, that's kind of what we were looking at, what we were comparing it to. So we had met with a company called EvenUp, and we had also looked into, we used SmartAdvocate for our internal software and we had met with them about their AI features that they offer. And so SmartAdvocate's, AI features did not compare at all to the abilities that Supioâ€™s AI features did, and then EvenUp the pricing was not comparable for, and they were just at that point when we had priced them, it was just for demands, just producing demand. I think they do offer AI stuff now, but when we had met with them, just the pricing for demands wasn't as appealing.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you remember if it was, how comparable it was, if it was double, was it 50% more?
Lisa Benson: No, I think it was the same kind of structure where it was incremental based on the amount of products. So the more demands we got, the cheaper it was. So I think it was probably a third more just for the demand production aspect of it. So I think it was something like $300 to $500 for the demand at the same level of production as we have from Supio. And then again, it didn't have the AI benefits and they continued to reach out and I said, Hey, we're going to utilize something that has an AI aspect. And they said, well, we do that too. But we had already met with Supio and were pleased with everything and knew that that was really something that was their main focus. We had also spoke to, his name is Igor from SmartAdvocate. Selizhuk I think is his last name. He is one of the marketing people at SmartAdvocate and he was aware of firms that other firms that uses SmartAdvocate software that also use Supio. He didn't give us any names, but he spoke highly of Supio.
Drew Giovannoli: In the comparison with EvenUp on the non-AI side, outside of price, was there any strengths or weaknesses comparison to the two that you could share?
Lisa Benson: Well, initially we really felt like EvenUp had a slower turnaround, so we were really hoping that Supio would be quicker because it was utilizing more AI. At least that was our understanding. Not necessarily that they sold that to us, but we kind of felt like because it had more of an AI component that it would be faster. We haven't necessarily seen that now that we have Supio, but that was something that was appealing is that it's going to be potentially price would be more something that we liked and then would be faster turnaround to get the demands. And then another thing was, and this is something, I wasn't involved in this conversation, but that we felt like we had a strong case for being able to pass the expense onto the client. There's certain things that you can make a case expense and certain things that you can't. And so being able to add to have the expense of using Supio, something that could be an expense that the client, for each case that the client absorbs was something that they liked and I feel like that they weren't a hundred percent certain that was something they could do with EvenUp.
Drew Giovannoli: You mentioned something about speed and how it wasn't resulting in the improvements in speed as you thought. Given the AI, do mind sharing any more specifics about what the speed was beforehand and what you hoped it would get to and maybe where you're at now?
Lisa Benson: Yeah, so it was usually taking about a week to get a demand back, and that was give or take depending on how big the demand size was. And we're looking at about a week now. I'm looking at the Supio dashboard now, so it's kind hard to tell because another thing that was nice about Supio is it was just, it was an ongoing thing, so we could onboard it at the beginning of a case and continue to use it throughout the case cycle, not just ask for one time demand. So some of these cases that I'm looking at the demand, they may have initially done a demand or a chronology, and then now we're updating and asking for a demand. So I don't have exact timelines on these, but it's looking like it is taking, looking at when dates things were uploaded, and then when it's been back, it looks like it's about a week turnaround time for us to get a demand back.
Drew Giovannoli: What were you hoping for?
Lisa Benson: I think, and again, this wasn't necessarily something that they told us, but I think maybe our understanding of the AI component, we didn't realize that there would still be a lot of hands on it, and so we were kind of thinking it would be the same day or next day, and that's probably not a realistic expectation, but I think we were hoping it would be quicker than what it is.
Drew Giovannoli: Let's move on to the AI piece. It sounds like it was something that was kind of a pleasant surprise past the other functionality. What have you found most valuable?
Lisa Benson: So it's just been neat to see all the different ways it can be utilized as far as looking at case value potential. Oh, the billing aspect is awesome. So they are actually always rolling out new things, which is exciting, but can also be from a training standpoint, we get trained a certain way and then it changes, but at the same time, we really all like the new updates. So it's a kind of give and take up there a little bit, but the ability to be able to have all the bills and records, I mean as far as the dates and to be able to look at if we have a bill but we don't have a record, and for it to flag that even being, I know that the attorneys really like being able to say, Hey, prepare this pleading for me. And obviously they examine it and add and take away from it, edit it, but how well it's able to prepare those pleadings has been exciting.
Drew Giovannoli: What do you wish it did better? Are there any areas that if you could choose the next update, where would you want them to prioritize?
Lisa Benson: Well, I think where right now we're kind of struggling is we're not seeing some of the accuracy that we would hope to see. And that's been just sort of recently where we have been seeing that as we're getting more and more demands back, that some of the demands are missing treatment. I just got an email from someone just before this call that it missed like $50,000 in billing. So bills that we uploaded, it didn't include in the demand, which we're told about $50,000. Let's see, this also has about 10 dates of service that it didn't catch. I know probably a few more than that, maybe 15 dates of service it didn't catch. So always as I've been training, I've always told team that this is a tool. It's not ever going to replace what you do because you're always going to have to have eyes on everything, but we do need to be able to rely on the accuracy.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you have any feedback on service and support? If you see those things and you reach out to the team, can you share what the experience is like?
Lisa Benson: Yes. So Phoebe has been our representative that I deal with and she is awesome. If I give her something, she'll say, let me look into that, and she'll give us, she'll always respond, entries, let us beta test some things. I dunno if maybe that's part of some of the slower timelines that we're seeing because we're kind of in on some early beta testing, but I just got an email from her as we were talking in response to something I'd sent. So she has been very good about having an open line of communication and wanting our feedback and then being very receptive to our feedback.
Drew Giovannoli: I have a few quantitative questions if you don't mind, where you could rank them one to five, where five is strongly agree, one is strongly disagree.
Drew Giovannoli: Supioâ€™s pricing was competitive and aligned with the value offered?
Lisa Benson: I would say five.
Drew Giovannoli: Next is company alignment. So Supioâ€™s, company values, culture, and overall approach are a good fit for our organization.
Lisa Benson: Five.
Drew Giovannoli: Functionality, Supioâ€™s product and service offer, the key features and capabilities we need to meet our requirements.
Lisa Benson: I would say five.
Drew Giovannoli: Implementation, the Supio sales team effectively communicated the process and their ability to just deliver a smooth onboarding experience?
Lisa Benson: I would say four.
Drew Giovannoli: And then technology, Supioâ€™s, technology platform and infrastructure appear robust, reliable, and aligned with your requirements?
Lisa Benson: I would say three. I mean I think it's obviously very valuable, but just for that, like I said, some of the discrepancies in and omissions that we have seen makes it, we're starting to feel a little bit less reli feel like it's a little bit less reliable.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you have any feedback on the implementation? What got it a four rating?
Lisa Benson: So I feel like a four is very positive, so I don't want it to be like we're not happy with implementing and especially Phoebe specifically. I think there's just because everything is so new, and again, we were grateful to be beta testing some things. I mean, since we've started, there's been I think five new features that they've added and that's just been in a couple months. So that training, sometimes it was difficult because we would train on something and then it would be something new and it was, that's understandable and obviously love all the new stuff, but sometimes that doesn't make for super easy training. And then we were a little unclear about the exact what it would look like. At one point they said they were going to come out and then that wasn't brought up again, and we didn't really push on that because we didn't know if there was necessarily a need for them to come all the way out here. But again, it wasn't super clear exactly, hey, we're going to meet these days, and then two to two weeks later and then two weeks later, if that would've been a little bit more outlined and a little bit more clearly, I think that would've gotten a five.
Drew Giovannoli: How about this sales experience? I don't know how involved you were along the way beforehand, but do you have any feedback on what they did well or areas they can improve as before you purchased them?
Lisa Benson: I was just in on one meeting before I think the contract was signed, and I think they did a great job of showing the features, and that was kind of what, so Dustin, he was one of the partners that was really our champion IT and all on board already. And then the other two partners seeing the way they demonstrated the way CPO could help with litigation, one of the other partners that he oversees litigation. So I could tell he was excited about the way that it could help with litigation. So I think that really sold the other two partners was that demo that I was a part of.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were to be a year from now and you have chosen to switch providers for some reason, what do you think that reason would be?
Lisa Benson: I think it would have to be if some of the accuracy issues didn't get resolved or if there was somebody that could work that could give us the product. When I say product, there's a couple, obviously we can go on and get the deep dive, that's pretty immediate. But the medical chronologies and the demands, if those could be rolled out even a day or two sooner because at the stage that we're kind of using those is typically when the client's done treating and now they want things to move pretty quickly. So I think, and maybe those two things are in conflict with each other, but if we had better accuracy and quicker turnaround times, I think that might be a reason.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there anything that I didn't ask you about related to Supio or the competitors that you think they'd benefit from learning from?
Lisa Benson: No, I don't think so. Again, we're super, me personally especially, I love just being kind of on the cutting edge of AI and being able to see how that's going to shape the way things are done and how we can start utilizing that now makes me excited and knowing that they are continuing to always look for new features to add, and so it's not like a stagnant thing. They're continuing to make it better and better, and so that makes me excited. I know that they're a young company and so we're excited to grow with them as they continue to develop.

An Interview with Justin Wyatt, Attorney at Wyatt Injury Law
Transcript
Buried Wins: How did you first learn about Supio?
Justin Wyatt: I believe that I heard about it at a CLE from some presenter discussing technology in firms and mentioned Supio along with many others. And then I spoke with a friend whose office uses Supio.
Buried Wins: What made Supio stand out enough to investigate it?
Justin Wyatt: Because it was AI related and it indicated we could use it to be more productive and save time.
Buried Wins: Did you have any key criteria that were important to you when evaluating?
Justin Wyatt: Cost, obviously, and what it could do and the product, the deliverable that would be providing.
Buried Wins: How big is your team and what's the split of roles?
Justin Wyatt: One attorney, four to six paralegals. I have an office manager.
Buried Wins: Did you evaluate any other vendors who are trying to solve the same problem?
Justin Wyatt: Litify. There's another one. I can't remember who it is. I think I took about three or four. Even Up was one for sure I talked to.
Buried Wins: Can you share how Supio compared strengths and weaknesses to these competitors?
Justin Wyatt: They're extremely expensive compared to the competitors. I liked their AI engine. I thought it was pretty helpful and they claimed it was proprietary. But then I went looked at everybody else and everybody else has something very similar. So I really didn't see anything particularly unique about Supio that would indicate I would give them the money they were requesting for the same stuff everybody else is doing. Also, it almost looked like a rebranded ChatGPT skin. And so that made me uncomfortable. And I think there are some questions regarding the HIPAA compliance on Supio's platform.
Buried Wins: Did you end up going with any of these technologies?
Justin Wyatt: Even Up, as of last week. Hasn't even onboarded yet.
Buried Wins: What strengths of EvenUp motivated going that direction?
Justin Wyatt: They fixed their billing structure and now it's case per case versus the credit structure, which was weird and it's quite flexible. It doesn't require a contract. I just buy what I buy and I use them or I don't and they roll over. So I thought that was pretty helpful and they were much more financially feasible than Supio.
Buried Wins: What other weaknesses or concerns did you have about Supio?
Justin Wyatt: I had talked to one of my other friends' firm who does use Supio and they had had challenges with kind of integrating their own structure for demands into the Supio platform and they had spent a tremendous amount of time dealing with Supio on that, which didn't make me very excited because I don't have a lot of time and I don't want to take on a bunch more stuff and pay for a service that's supposed to be saving me time, actually costing me time and making my job harder.
Buried Wins: On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree, how would you rate: ""Supio's pricing was competitive and aligned with the value it offered""?
Justin Wyatt: One. Strongly disagree. I thought they were very expensive and not competitive to the others that I looked at.
Buried Wins: ""Supio's product or service offered key features or capabilities we needed to meet our requirements.""
Justin Wyatt: Probably three to four, somewhere in that range. It looked to be pretty innovative, but it still had work to do.
Buried Wins: Was there any feedback, positive or negative, on the sales engagement?
Justin Wyatt: I don't remember anything specifically. I didn't have any issues with that person. Seemed like it was a man and he was pretty knowledgeable. I was turned off by the cost and then what appeared to me that they were just repackaging ChatGPT. And again with the HIPAA compliance issue. And then when I spoke to my friend who uses them, there were other issues that they had been dealing with that turned me off to Supio. But as far as the salesperson themselves, they did fine job.
Buried Wins: If you were the CEO of Supio, what would you prioritize first to better serve a company like yours?
Justin Wyatt: Differentiating themselves from what's available for free under Notebook AI or ChatGPT. Have a product that's unique enough that you can justify the expense. Number two, have a pretty flexible billing structure or various types of billing. The HIPAA compliance is essential for attorneys we bill in HIPAA every single day of the week. So if you're not HIPAA compliant, doesn't make sense to even have a conversation past that point. And then training and integration challenges is what I would focus on.
Buried Wins: Is there anything else about the technology space or Supio that they would gain value from hearing about?
Justin Wyatt: They need to probably improve their ability to create individualized products for firms because firms have their own templates and platforms and things that they like and don't like in their demand packets and that seems to be an issue. I know the firm that I talked to had huge issues and spent a tremendous amount of time with Supio's team to get it what they wanted and were still struggling with that.",,,7/23/2025 3:50pm

An Interview with Michael Rhodes, Attorney at Mix Sanders Thompson
Transcript
Drew Giovannoli: So you mentioned you met this rep at a CLE conference. Were you looking for a solution to a certain pain point when you went and found Supio, or was it circumstantial?
Michael Rhodes: Circumstantial.
Drew Giovannoli: And once you started evaluating Supio, did you start looking at other vendors as well?
Michael Rhodes: Well, I think a year ago or so, it's just an interest in AI. Like, everyone's using it to some extent, but there's maybe a crowded marketplace or attorneys just don't know where to look. So there's just a vendor there that had interesting marketing materials. And she was friendly. So it was more exploratory than looking to purchase something at that moment.
Drew Giovannoli: As you considered it, even as an option, was there any criteria you had for potentially purchasing?
Michael Rhodes: No, I don't think so. Just whether it be a fit is kind of the bigger issue.
Drew Giovannoli: How many people are at Mix Sanders? Is it just you? Do you have other attorneys or paralegals?
Michael Rhodes: I think there's 11 or 12 attorneys. So then with staff, probably 25 to 30.
Drew Giovannoli: As you started talking to Supio or the rep, were other people involved? Do you bring in operations folks to help you evaluate it, or was this kind of a personal investigation?
Michael Rhodes: Just personal investigation.
Drew Giovannoli: If it had gone further, who else would you have brought in?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, I'd bring in the managing partner, the founder of the company, and then my office manager. And then if we made a decision, it would be with the group of partners.
Drew Giovannoli: Did you see anybody else in the space that you checked out?
Michael Rhodes: Well, I know my firm has checked out. Westlaw has its own. I can't think of top of my head what it's called right now, so I know that they have looked into that this year. We haven't signed a contract with them, but it's something that is of interest. I think they like the presentation.
Drew Giovannoli: What are the use cases you think the law firm is excited about using AI for?
Michael Rhodes: That's a good question. So I think the Westlaw one is probably more related to research and briefing us, where it probably does your work for you on the legal analysis. I haven't been part of the presentation, so I don't know that for sure. But typically that's what Westlaw Tools do.
And then with Supio. So I didn't know what it was going into it. So I really liked it. But the problem with the business model on the defense side, I do mostly defense work is the paralegals can bill for the work that Supio does. So it's like we do a lot of work for insurance companies. So if a paralegal does a claim chronology or medical record summary, we can bill thousands of dollars for that and have revenue for the firm. Supio can do it in like two minutes. So it's like from a cost effective analysis from the plaintiff's side, it's way cheaper and faster to use Supio to do that kind of work. But then from a defense side, it's like we make money doing it the old way. So when they make us stop doing it the old way, then Supio would be something that would be cost effective. But it's just that, and you could technically just have AI do the work and have the paralegal bill for it. But I think people are leery to go that route for ethical reasons.
Drew Giovannoli: Was that a key driver not going forward with Supio?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, mostly that we just do defense work. Well, I do some plaintiff's work, but yeah, I think the fit of it.
Drew Giovannoli: Even though you can pass on the costs, the costs are lower than the paralegal hours, is that right?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, right. Like the paralegal. We would make money with the. It's tricky because sometimes you have to pay the paralegals too.
Drew Giovannoli: But you have like a built in margin on top of the paralegals work. Right. You pay them x an hour, you charge somebody else why an hour?
Michael Rhodes: Exactly. Yeah. And then you have relationships. You can't just fire all your paralegals and you say I. I mean, if you started over, you probably would do that. You probably say I don't need paralegals. Like, they're kind of dated, but.
Drew Giovannoli: What appealed to you? What would you find interesting about the product itself?
Michael Rhodes: Well, I just think the medical record summary so advanced where you can just plug in documents and it puts together the summary. I think that's something in the old days used to take hours and hours from a paralegal to do and just what was presented to me, it looked pretty accurate that they flagged stuff. They can see trends. So I thought that was really valuable. I like the idea that the documents could talk to each other. You could ask for advice. So I liked that idea. I don't know how much you would actually use it. Like, you can use AI like open AI to ask those kind of questions, and they'll give you a bunch of information. But then it's like you don't because you kind of know what to do anyway, so. It's tricky.
Drew Giovannoli: Any concerns or blockers you'd see in using it as they pitched it to you?
Michael Rhodes: No, but probably just whatever cost. I mean, if I have my own firm and did plaintiff's work, if it was cost effective, I think it was presented to me well enough where I would have trusted them to do that kind of work.
Drew Giovannoli: I don't think I fully understand the difference in why it would matter if it was plaintiff's first defense.
Michael Rhodes: Oh, yeah. Okay, so plaintiff's case, let's say it's a we'll just say an extreme example, right. Sexual assault. Right. Could be a $2 million case. So a plaintiff attorney could bring you in, interview you. And then they say, well, we need your records, or at least the relevant ones. So what they need to do to get money from the defense side is they need to collect the records, summarize them and prepare a demand. I think Supio can do almost all that work the analysis, the summary, and then you put your letterhead on it. So it would, from a time perspective, from the plaintiff attorney, would do most of the work. You'd do about five hours work. Supio would do what would take you 10 or 20 hours of work from the defense side. So then if you use AI, it's way more cost effective. You don't have to pay a paralegal or legal assistant to draft it. They would just do it. And it doesn't have to be perfect on the plaintiff's side. Right. The defense side analyzes things differently so that information would come in. And we don't trust their sources. We don't trust their information. So we would want to see the medical records. We would want to review them. We would want to do a background investigation, really flush it out. So there's a lot of work on our end. I think that's different. And then we get paid by the hour. So it's like if we do investigation for five, ten hours, it's like we get paid X amount of money. So if you have tools that cut down on your work time, then potentially depending on your volume, you're cutting down on how much you get paid.
Drew Giovannoli: And plaintiff attorneys don't get paid by the hour.
Michael Rhodes: No, they would just say, okay, well, we'll just give you $2 million and I'll say, great, we did five hours worth of work. We got $1 million. And that's on a contingency basis, right?
Drew Giovannoli: Do they get a portion of the payout?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah. So they get like 33% or 40% of the payout. So on the plaintiff side, if they could do work as little work as possible, that benefits them on everything. And then the defense side we are it's such a dumb. It's so dumb to be a defense attorney. But we get paid by the hour. So we get between two and six per hour. So we are more thorough on the kinds of work we do.
And some it's like. At some point the smart attorneys I don't know about ethical, but the really smart defense attorneys would just use AI and then bill it like they build the same analysis. But I don't know anyone that's comfortable with doing that. So work which is the workhorses.
Drew Giovannoli: How many meetings did you have with Supio?
Michael Rhodes: Just one.
Drew Giovannoli: Price functionality, 1 to 5 where five is strongly agree. Was pricing competitive and aligned with the value offered?
Michael Rhodes: I just don't remember.
Drew Giovannoli: Supio's overall approach and company values are a good fit for our organization.
Michael Rhodes: Two.
Drew Giovannoli: Was it because of the pricing structure?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, well, just the fit of it. The pricing structure and fit. Right. Like, it might not make economic sense to do it that way from the defense side.
Drew Giovannoli: Functionality. Superior product service offered key features and capability needed to meet our requirements.
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, I didn't use it, so I just saw the presentation, I would say. Five. I was impressed with the presentation.
Drew Giovannoli: What other tools do you use today? Do you have a case management software?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, we use Clio for case management. We use Google Drive and Gmail. So that's for we used to use Dropbox, now we use Box.com and Microsoft Word, PDF expert. Slack. Zoom.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were to have used Supio, were there any integrations that would be useful for you or valuable to you?
Michael Rhodes: Not that I'm aware of.
Drew Giovannoli: Do you have any feedback on the sales call itself?
Michael Rhodes: I mean, I like that they didn't like hound me to follow up. Which in some ways is like, maybe they should, but also like, they knew it wasn't a fit. I feel like I don't know that that's true, but I do appreciate that. No, I think if it's a different circumstance, I'd be interested.
Drew Giovannoli: Can you tell me a little bit more about Westlaw? Why is that kind of a different feel or cost, association or value to you when it comes to paying for new AI tools?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, it's a good question. From the attorney side, we just work all the time. And so the hardest work is legal analysis and research. So we can do like, busy work and bill 500 an hour. But to really dive deep on a legal issue, which is what we get paid for our expertise. It would be helpful to have the work done up front. It's like a textbook with the answers, like you just have a textbook. That's all right. You can learn. But if you have the answers and then you can work backwards, that would be beneficial.
Drew Giovannoli: Does it not have the same concern that it makes you faster and there's less billable hours?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, it's a good question because he's still probably write it out and you still have to fact check the AI. So they might draft you a memo or brief, but you still have to go in there and look at all the cases anyway.
Drew Giovannoli: Does it have to do perhaps with. It's like a legal or a lawyer tool versus a paralegal tool?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah, I think so. Well, because the lawyers can still justify their jobs, right. Using a tool like that and then paralegals like, in some ways you couldn't justify their job if they couldn't do chronologies and medical record summaries. Like, I don't know what they would do all day if they didn't do that work.
I don't know what they do anyway for my office as it is. But yeah, Westlaw would be for lawyers and not paralegals. Sometimes it's just hard work. It would be helpful, I think AI can be, the weakness of it is you have younger attorneys that don't know what they're doing that will just use it and rely on it, but it's pretty accurate, I imagine. So it's probably fine. But I didn't see that presentation, so I actually don't know for sure. On the left side.
Drew Giovannoli: If you were the CEO of Supio, what would you do to better serve companies like yourself?
Michael Rhodes: I mean, I think you want to be a vendor for Washington State Association of Justice. They probably are. But that's the plaintiff bar there. So they have their hooks in everything on the plaintiff's side. So you just want to be front and center, making presentations and meeting people. So it almost feels more about marketing than about actually the service, I think. Like, you get in tight with the group. I think you're going to develop relationships, and there's a lot more money on the plaintiff's side, too. And there's so much more opportunity, like, you get a solo practitioner, there's a bunch, if you can pitch it to a solo. You can make a ton of money doing that way. Having a nice little relationship. Because the solo is you could be an attorney and have 5 to 10 cases a year and probably get by, and maybe you'd be good. Maybe you're not, but you have to do two thirds of your work like you're working 15 hours a week. Like, that's not bad. You're making a couple hundred. That's not bad. Just the defense side. So much different. But I would say the big thing is plaintiff's bar stuff. And I don't know about other areas of employment or business. I just didn't get that impression from Supio, like, if it would be helpful.
Drew Giovannoli: Is there one for every state?
Michael Rhodes: There is. Yes.
Drew Giovannoli: So they could hypothetically go. And if they don't already.
Michael Rhodes: Yeah. Well yeah that's what I'm saying. Like, you just have to weasel your way into being also sponsor, right?
Michael Rhodes: Yeah. There's a national one. The national one's called the American Association for justice. And the real big money's in that because everyone can afford state association dues. The national dues are going to be more. But you also are dealing with, I mean, I don't know how Supio how big they are. I just don't know if that's like feasible. But on a national scale, they have big conferences.
At the big conferences. I don't know how much you actually hang out with the vendors though, because there's so many people there's those conferences are a mess on the state level. Like, you probably get to know people a lot better.
Michael Rhodes: You know, the one thing is. Okay, so I'm the immediate past president of the Washington defense trial lawyers, right? We're a group on the other side. And we have our core sponsors, too. I just like to be a bit, but on the defense side, I just don't see it right now having value. On the other hand, I don't think we have an AI vendor. So, and a lot of people on my side switch over to plaintiff's work or mediation. So it could be I don't think it's that much like on the plaintiff's side, they probably charge like 20 grand or more. For vendors. Our side, it's like four grand or something. Kind of modest. So. I mean, it could be an expense to get out and build relationships and referrals.
Because I met them at Aboda. That's like a joint one, right? It's trial lawyers for defense and plaintiffs. So I was there to hang out.",,,7/23/2025 3:50pm

An Interview with Ben Scott, Partner at Wells Call Clark Bennett & Clawson
Transcript
Drew: If you don't mind just introducing your role specifically at your firm, what you're responsible for.
Ben: Yeah, so we've got a personal injury firm, four attorneys at the firm, and we've got a staff of a total, including attorneys about 15. And so my role, Iâ€™m one of the partners so typically my main role is look, I'm over marketing, so that's kind of my hat I wear, but I also do a lot of the operation stuff and figuring out, okay, how we run it, how are we managing things. Usually when it comes to tech stuff, I'm usually the one who's researching it before anybody else and anything that's going to be innovative and helping the practice, that's where I'll usually start. I'll start there and then I'll bring it to Mike because I've got two partners and then one associate, so we'll bring it to the partners and we'll discuss it and usually it's any big decisions, we're going to make sure we're on the same page and make those together.
Drew: What prompted or triggered you to evaluate solutions like Supio?
Ben: So obviously we know the need for using AI. It's such a great tool to be able to help make things faster and better and be able to serve our clients better. I actually met them at Supio at a conference, I think it was a trial lawyers university. I think I met them there, met several different vendors and I said, I know this is something I need. Let me take this time to talk to these vendors and figure out what people are offering that is, because obviously I know, look, I know there's a value to it, there's a need.
Drew: Did you go to the conference thinking, Hey, I have some tools I think I need, let me find the right one. Or was it like, let me see what tools are even available these days?
Ben: A little bit of both. I kind of like to go with an open mind. Obviously I go to the conference to always, I try and pick conferences where I'm going to learn a lot, where there's going to be something good and connect with people. But I also know that part of it is I know that these vendors help make the conference possible. So look, I want to make sure I'm supporting those vendors who were there and talk to them, but I usually go, okay, here's some needs we have. And I say, look, is there anybody there? But also with an open mind, maybe there's something I haven't heard of before that's going to actually be, well, the thing we never knew that we needed that we do.
Drew: Had you heard of Supio before you got to that event?
Ben: I hadn't. That was the first time I've heard of them.
Drew: You mentioned one conference. What other conferences should Supio really value or top conferences for them to be at? 
Ben: So I think the one is the TLU is probably one of the top conferences. I mean, I can speak for what I go to and what I enjoy and I know there's, if they were at TBI, Med-Legal, didnâ€™t do that one this year, but that's always a good conference. And then if there's, I'm trying to think of anything else I went to recently. No, as far as what I go to, I don't go to the A tech show or those type of things.
Drew: As you went, did you walk away with an idea of any key criteria that if you're going to hire a tool like this, that they had to be X, Y, or Z?
Ben: Not really. I think a couple things we looked at, I broke them up into two categories really, because I think where it can really do the most good is in doing the medical records. Those can be really voluminous, take a lot of time. And to have the ability to go through and summarize those records is huge. And then you can take that summary and use that to draft demands, draft briefs and that type of thing. So I saw that as, I guess where you get most useful.
So I looked, one category was similar to Supio is the ones that hey, we able to, you're basically paying per case and you're able to, you're not limited on the amount of documents you're paying one price per case. And then not only are you doing the medical records, but you're doing everything else that you need to as well. You can draft interrogatories, you can review other documents that you need to as well. So kind of like a full service, right? So you got the full service model, they do the medical records, but they also do a lot of other things. I think there was one other one that I saw that fits in that, and that would be Eve is the other one that I think fits that category. And then there were a bunch of other ones that they focused solely on the, they say, Hey, we'll just do a medical record summary for you using the AI. Some of them were, and they had different pricing models.
Drew: There's a few different approaches to these problems using AI in the legal space and medical records of those. What stood out to you as being the most valuable of things like, oh, this is an area that would be worth our time investing in?
Ben: So kind of the ones I looked and then the others, I mean, all the ones that were just medical record review, they had different pricing models and they didn't have anything that stood out as, okay, who's the best at doing this? And so I think the one just as far as the pricing structure, that was understandable and that made sense to us. I think if we were just going to do that I think was the Gemini, which I think is JudyAI does that, and then there's some other ones. Some of them had pricing models were like, Hey, you pay a monthly subscription fee, you do unlimited others or you pay per page. And so that was always a little hard to go through. Well, what's going to be the best deal for us? How much are we using it? A lot of questions for us to answer.
Drew: And my notes show you did not choose Supio, right? You went in another direction?
Ben: Well, we didn't choose another vendor per se either. So mainly the direction we went is Claude using mainly on our own, just doing that.
Drew: How exactly are you using Claude or for what tasks are you using it?
Ben: I like Claude because you use it for anything. I am actually using it right now. I'm starting to eat healthier and so I'm using it as my personal nutrition, my nutrition trainer as far as that. But as far as the legal side goes, obviously the simple thing is like, Hey, I'm drafting this email. I want you to go through it. I'm using it to draft interrogatories. We've got, our new paralegal we hired is using it a lot and drafting interrogatories, responding, Hey, how do you to review the responses you have come up with deposition questions and I just had an arbitration. And so it was great at the creative stuff like, Hey, I want to develop the questions to ask this witness and this is what I want to get out of this witness. I want to do it in the style of such and such an attorney.
And so you can really get a lot of great ideas on that. I use it a lot for the demand letters and mediation briefs. You do it for closing argument, so that's where it's, I think the creative stuff is really where it shines, where you're really able to, what I do notice is it gets facts wrong a lot, so you got to be careful. It cites fake cases still those, and so we got to double check and verify. Every time it does a citation, we've got to do that. But the limitation of course is you've got file size, right? You're not able to, you run into the limits. Eventually the chat's going to run out where even though we've got, we are paying for the team plan, you still run out of space. So that's the limitation we find.
Drew: When you think about Claude versus a tool like Eve or EvenUp, you mentioned size, cost is an obvious factor, and then I'd imagine there's some features and functionality differences, at least make your life easier. Would you say it was a cost decision, a functionality decision, or just didn't drive enough value? Where in the world of sticking with Claude versus using an independent tool, Supio or not, how do you kind of land at that decision and how do you see it going forward?
Ben: I think obviously cost is always a factor because it was a big investment to do it. I think really it's the jumping into that type of cost while you're still jumping into the unknown because here they're asking for, with Supio, it was a lot of money upfront where you say, Hey, you're going to guarantee you're doing this many cases, you're going to pay for all of these cases upfront. And without knowing yet, is this going to provide the value that I need where it's still pretty new, we're still figuring things out and also knowing that the landscape is changing and evolving so quickly, we're locking something down for a year, but in a year from now, how different is it going to be? What other options are going to be out there? So I think that was the hardest thing is to make such a big commitment. While there was still so much we didn't know about how valuable it would be.
Drew: Were there any companies that did a better job helping you see the value or I guess forecasting the value into the future gave you more confidence in that? Obviously you didn't go with any others, but just in learning how to position and sell, anybody else give you more confidence?
Ben: Not really. I think I saw the value and the Supio salespeople were great, so they were very good, easy to work with and I think answer all my questions, but I think it was the work we were looking, okay, how much are we spending? And obviously it looks a lot more when you're looking at, okay, this is not an, even though you're looking at, okay, they give you a per case a price, but then we're looking, okay, this is going to be a $40,000 investment. It's a lot harder to look at that and see that size of the investment.
Drew: Sure. Price aside, can you share any strengths or weaknesses you saw with the functionality, things you were maybe excited by or gaps that you were worried about?
Ben: So I never got a chance to really try it out. It was I gave them a case and they kind of uploaded it and they showed it to me, but it wasn't like we didn't have a trial run, say, Hey, you get to play with it for a week or anything. So I didn't really get to see, okay, the functionality other than the demo we did with them.
Drew: Did anybody else provide you free trial periods?
Ben: Yeah, I did get to try out Eve and I got a few cases I was able to try it out on. And so I mean, it was helpful to do that and it's where I can, I haven't delved into it so much where there's a lot of things you can do where you can program and say, okay, this is going to be our template for a demand letter that we're doing and you can set up your templates and preferences. So I didn't do all of that, which is pretty valuable.
Drew: Sure. Well maybe if you didn't see Supio, I would love to hear on the Eve side. Well, and the feature, the functionalities, anything that excited you or weaknesses you wish you had access to or capabilities of?
Ben: I think between the Eve and the Supio, they're pretty similar as far as I understand. They're pretty similar as far as functionality, what they can do. They're both pretty similar product. We're like, Hey, we're giving you the full service where the big thing is the medical record summary and it's going to give you some analysis of it. And then I did notice just on the general, if I do AI queries and stuff, I'm not sure if you can change the language. It did seem like what I actually get from Claude seems to be better. I don't know if they're using Claude's language model or not, but it seemed a little more superficial.
Drew: Got it. You've mentioned sales before, and if it's okay, I'll ask you just a few questions. If you could rank them one to five or five as you strongly agree with the statement or one is strongly disagree, is that okay?
Ben: Sure.
Drew: It's about the sales experience and I know that you didn't go deep into it, so you can also just say don't have enough information, but first one was Supioâ€™s pricing was competitive and aligned with the value they offered. Five being strongly agree, one being strongly disagree.
Ben: I'd say four.
Drew: Supioâ€™s company values, culture and approach were a good fit for our organization.
Ben: Probably don't have enough to really. I didn't go delve into their values, what their company's core values are.
Drew: That's okay. Supioâ€™s product and service offered key features, capabilities. We needed to meet our requirements.
Ben: Say four.
Drew: Supioâ€™s sales team effectively communicated implementation and their ability to deliver a smooth onboarding experience.
Ben: Probably a four on that. I don't remember that specifically, but I know they were good.
Drew: Last one, Supioâ€™s technology and infrastructure appeared robust, reliable, and aligned with your technical requirements?
Ben: I'd say a five.
Drew: I was excited to hear how you're using Claude and viewing the landscape. I think that's an impressive approach to it, more hands-on than a lot of the folks that I've talked to so far. You're a partner at this firm, it seems like you're also in charge of marketing and you're in charge of technology and ops. How do you balance all of that?
Ben: We're always busy, but I guess I need to do more Gina Wickman and get the right people in the right seat so I can do less of that myself. Right?
Drew: You mentioned the hallucinations. Is there anything else you wish Claude allowed you to do or was made easier for you that it doesn't have today in your AI journey?
Ben: So yeah, we talked about the hallucination and then I think the big thing is just the ability to do larger files, which I think they just came out with their max plan that I guess you can do a little bit more. And I saw something like they have whatever they call their deep thinking one where they'll process something for half an hour, but you can put a lot more into it. So I think they're coming out with that, but that's probably the biggest one is they're not going to be able to process just large amounts of information.
Current subscription. And the other, of course is there's kind of in this landscape now where nobody really knows the answers as far as, well what we put out there, how secure is it? We have an ethical dilemma because basically there's opinions out there, ethics opinions that say, look, if we're not using AI, then we're committing malpractice. But then there's also opinions that say, well, if we're using AI, you are committing malpractice because your client data is getting out there in the cloud and stuff. And so that dilemma is okay, the clarity, you ask it and you try and figure it out. It's not always very clear, okay, what's done with this information, what information can we share and what can we not?
Drew: Would you walk me through the rest of your tech stack around Claude? Any other tools you use on a regular basis?
Ben: Yeah, so have, well, our paralegal mainly just uses this one. She does our discovery one's called Briefpoint. That's helping just draft discovery responses and it'll set up the template. It'll come up with questions to propound. Then we have, for our case management, we use Filevine. And then we have with that we have Hona that integrates with Filevine. That's basically with communication with clients. So it's like they get automatic updates on what's happening with their case, tells us, and then what else do we have? Then we have, I mean, those are the big things. Other then yeah, you've got Microsoft Outlook or your email and all that, but I think as far as the tech stuff, that's what, and then we also have Lead Docket for tracking our leads.
Drew: Can you tell me a little bit more about how you use Filevine, if you don't mind?
Ben: So file line, you're familiar with it, right? Yeah. So mainly, and I'm not using the AI on file, that was pretty pricey, but mainly it's just, hey, what is a case management tool? So you're keeping track of cases, using it, communicating with clients, keeping track of all the information, and we're a little behind on getting it to do all our document generation and stuff. We know the capabilities there, but we're not using it to its fullest. But for the most part it's a way to just, hey, every case I can open up the case and I can know what's going on with the case. I see all the notes and see all the, we text our clients and keep track of it there. So that's really the idea is replace paper file as much as we can.
Drew: Yeah, I was, I guess trying to subtly lead you down to see if you were using the AI in any way and for Filevine, because I know that sometimes they're kind of competing more and more with even Supio on the AI side.
Ben: Yeah, I tried it, but I probably tried it in its infancy. It was pretty terrible when I first tried it out.
Drew: How long ago was that?
Ben: Oh, it was probably a year and a half for the price they were doing. I had to do some medical summaries and they had this weird pricing model they had where it's like, okay, you're paying for every single question you ask. And so they probably changed it, but it was a pretty confusing pricing model. And then when I actually did it to demo something, I'm like, the product I got was like, this doesn't even help me. There's not even any good.
Drew: There are seemingly many pricing models out there that AI companies are attempting to go to market with. Did any resonate with you as just the clearest or the easiest or as just like, this is how I would prefer to pay when it came down to it?
Ben: I think really it's the two that just makes sense are look, just the flat price. You're paying this much and you get the unlimited access to it of what other service you're using or the model you got. Supio is the pay per case because a lot of times we don't know how much something's going to cost and we're like, well, the idea is the cases you really need it on are the ones that have a larger files, larger medical records. And then, well, I've got 2000 pages of records here. A lot's going to cost way more money than it's worth. And then the ones that have small records, they like, well, I don't really need it. It's small enough I can go through without the AI and go through it and do pretty well.
Drew: I had heard from you, the case by case is a bit challenging because you have to one predict, right?
Ben: Where it's case by case where you agree to like, Hey, from the very beginning you say, oh, you're going to do 400 cases or whatever it may be. That's a little harder because we don't always know which cases we're going to need it on. And because not every case needs some cases are just fine, Hey, we can just run it through Claude, Claude, we're not going to run into problems with it.
Drew: How would you determine if you were going to use it? And it sounds like you would consider still using Claude, you'd have both what cases would go to what?
Ben: Really? I think it comes down to just the volume of medical records that you have. I think that's the biggest factor is like, okay, is this a case where at least what I know right now, right? If things can change, if we find that, hey, this is so efficient and so great, we can just streamline and do it on all our cases, maybe that would make sense down the road. But without, I guess trying it out and kind of building out a few cases, I am not going to know does it make sense to use it for all our cases or it did it better? And yeah, and when you look at it that way, the cost per case, that's actually pretty easy to recoup. You just make it a client cost and then it's not when you say, oh, it's $250 on this case. So that's not a big deal. Very easily spend a lot more money than that on a case. But then yeah, obviously we look at the big number and it's like, oh, that's a lot of money when you just write that one check for all that money.
Drew: So with Claude, I'm curious what you think the future looks like. You're looking at all these tools in your firm. Is this something you're evaluating every year at every event? Is it something you've kind of said, let's look at this once a year, you are also doing marketing and your partner at the firm?
Ben: No, it's always something that's top of mind. I think it's part of who I am too is, I'm always willing to try something new and always say, Hey, let's continually progress, continually get better. And my partners are a little slower on that, which it actually creates a good balance because I'll come in, Hey, I saw this, this is a good, we should do this. And I was like, hold on for a second, let's really look at this. And so it does create a pretty good synergy where I'm looking at innovation, always looking at new things to do and they're a little slower, which can be frustrating at times, but also it's good to recognize that. All right, there's value to that too, is that value to taking the time to really look at everything in more detail.",,,7/23/2025 3:50pm

An Interview with Elyssa Goldstein, Chief Operating Officer at Rebenack Aronow & Mascolo
Transcript
Drew: Can you tell me in your own words what your role entails at RAM Law, what your responsibilities are there?
Elyssa: Sure. If I was meeting you in an elevator and I had five seconds, I would say that I do everything to help our business run. To expand on that a little bit, I'm sort of managing all the non-law practicing departments or functionalities for the firm. So we have bookkeepers, I'm overseeing them, doing financial planning and analysis with partners, talking to our outside accountants and advisors. That includes our 401k account, which then sends into things like benefits, healthcare, supplemental benefits, as well as the software and technology piecesâ€”upgrades, adding products like Supio, staffing, performance management, hiring, firing facilities, upkeep, all of our insurances and vendor contacts. I could keep going, but that's a high level of everything. It is not boring, I'll tell you that.
Drew: No, it seems like it's a very wide scope and has a lot of different problems to solve, so it sounds like it would stay interesting.
Elyssa: Yes, indeed. I'm luckyâ€”most people hopefully kind of maybe like their job, but I legitimately love it, so I'm lucky.
Drew: The conversation is going to be based around the tools that you use and specifically your evaluation of tools like Supio. Can you tell me about the first instance of you connecting with them? Was it them reaching out to you or you reaching out to them?
Elyssa: I think it was kind of a convergence of events. Both myself and my partners go to a lot of industry conferences and events. I believe one of my partners, Matt Amalio, either met someone from Supio or saw a demo at a conference, perhaps a New Jersey Association of Justice conference.
Drew: Can you list out what you consider to be the conferences that you go to or your team goes to that you really value learning from?
Elyssa: Sure. From a partner side, they do New Jersey Association stuff. There's actually a boardwalk seminar that happens in Atlantic City. We also do things with the New Jersey State Bar Association. We have several lawyers involved in the Academy of Truck Accident Attorneys. Also, the American Association for Justice has a trucking subgroup that some of our partners are part of. For me personally, I'm a member and a board member of the Association of Legal Administrators. Supio was actually a sponsor for our virtual conference back in February. I had learned about them shortly after we started demos at our firm, which I think our first demo was maybe in January.
Drew: When you started to look at Supio, were you using an existing tool that does what Supio does or did you have nothing like it before?
Elyssa: No, we were not using any outside company to help us with medical records or demands or anything like that. We weren't really using another AI other than maybe some people poking around on ChatGPT. We had switched our legal research platform from LexisNexis to Westlaw and there was a little AI pieceâ€”they have a product called Co-Counsel and we didn't take the full suite, but we took a query piece of it. But we didn't have the option to upload and do the data dump that we do with Supio.
Drew: What was the initial impression of the software considering you're going from managing it in-house? In the range from complete acceptance to complete resistance, how did you and the company perceive it to start?
Elyssa: I think we really liked it originally. That first meeting, I believe it was just me and one partner, Matt, who I mentioned before. We were looking at a lot of things at the start of the year, a lot of different products, and we weren't quite sure specifically what we wanted. Supio just came across our desk as an AI tool, and we knew we wanted to incorporate some piece of AI to enhance or streamline some parts of our practice. We were basically going to go with whatever struck our fancy and seemed to be the most well-developed and supported product.
Drew: After that first meeting, who else was involved in the evaluation process?
Elyssa: Mostly throughout the process it was this one partner, Matt, and I. We had maybe one or two meetings. We did do a meeting with the rest of our partnersâ€”there's five partners in totalâ€”so we brought on the other four and I think three out of four were able to attend so they could see the product for themselves. We also discussed it in partners meetings and shared information back and forth. But I would say that really it was Matt and I driving both the AI initiative in general and then specifically the selection of Supio.
Drew: Was there any specific criteria as you looked at these different AI tools that they had to fulfill to make it into your consideration?
Elyssa: Sure. We wanted something thorough in the work it was going to do. Something that we felt was secure and had enough support where it wasn't a fledgling type of product that would soon be gone because it didn't have enough funding or tech support or enough people working there. The alert really for us also was the scope of what it did, but the fact that we could push an invoice and use it to bill back our clients, which we've just started. When the time comes, we'll have a nice clean invoice for each case. I was just on an AI chat yesterday with other legal administrators and they were demoing products that cost thousands of dollars a month with no way to pass the cost to clients. We have a different bill model as plaintiff's firms, but Supio was one of the only companies I saw that could fairly allocate expenses for us, which is huge.
Drew: Who else did you evaluate?
Elyssa: As our document management practice we use Madison Software and they have something like Draft and some different AI tools that don't quite do what Supio does. We looked at that as an add-on and didn't feel it was really flushed out. The most comparable product we looked at was Filevine, which is another practice management software. We looked at their AI product which did do medical chronologies, and we do use a Filevine product called The Docket for our intake software. So we have that existing relationship, but it did not seem as thorough as Supio's, and they did not offer the same pricing structure where we could bill things back easily.
Drew: You mentioned something about the pricing structure that was really important. Could you expand on that?
Elyssa: Having the ability to clearly allocate costs to our clients is important. We're in a good financial position and we're smart about investing in the business. If we had found something really transformative to our practice but couldn't bill it back, we might've taken it on anyway. But the fact that we can say, ""here's our monthly bill"" and literally part and parcel it out to specific clients to recover those costs is amazing.
In plaintiff's law, we only get paid when we settle a case. To use simple math, if the settlement is $100,000 and there's $10,000 of expenses, we subtract the expenses from the settlement and then there's $90,000 left. We get $30,000 which is one-third and the client gets $60,000. So we are automatically deducting those expenses. It's not a situation where somebody has to approve it or a corporate company might reject it saying research software is just part of doing business. It's very clear for us to allocate things without guessing. It's a really clean process start to finish with Supio.
Drew: You mentioned Filevine and you had an existing relationship, but it didn't meet the demand. Were there others that were close to Filevine and Supio that you looked at?
Elyssa: We looked at a company called EvenUp that we weren't as impressed with. The products from LexisNexis AI Plus and Co-Counsel from Westlaw weren't quite what we were looking forâ€”they were much more legal research focused. We're also working with a company called Remote Legal, which uses AI for depositions on a non-Zoom platform that can clip videos and have transcripts. Again, that is different than what Supio offers. We were exploring all over the mapâ€”anything that had an AI piece we were looking into.
Drew: Was there anything specific about EvenUp that you can recall or found in your files?
Elyssa: I think there wasn't static pricing with themâ€”it depended on volume, which made it hard for us. Something specific to plaintiff's law is the fact that we are laying out expenses in advance and then waiting for settlement. We might incur expenses early on a case and carry that expense on our books for three years. So to know with Supio that we are paying a set number of dollars per month is very helpful from a budgeting standpoint and a cashflow standpoint. EvenUp's pricing depended on volume and their turnaround time might be longer for demands. We were thrown off by the fact that it was going to be hard to predict pricing.
Drew: Can I ask you a set of one to five questions where one is strongly disagree and five is strongly agree?
Elyssa: Okay.
Drew: The first question is on price. Supio's pricing was competitive and aligned with the value offered.
Elyssa: Probably four.
Drew: Company alignment. Supio's company values, culture, and overall approach were a good fit for our organization.
Elyssa: Also a four.
Drew: Functionality. Supio's product service offered the key features and capabilities we needed to meet our requirements.
Elyssa: Five.
Drew: Implementation. The Supio sales team effectively communicated the implementation process and their ability to deliver a smooth onboarding experience.
Elyssa: Four.
Drew: And last one, technology. Supio's technology platform and infrastructure appeared robust, reliable, and aligned with our technology requirements.
Elyssa: Four.
Drew: Great. So one of those is a standout, which was the functionality of Supio's product and service key features. Would you expand on what you think they do well, those strengths that earned that score?
Elyssa: Their bread and butter is the summarization of medical records and the chronology. We have cases that are very comprehensive, and the fact that I can go through things quickly, pull up timelinesâ€”it has links to pages. There was one product we looked at where they did the summary but didn't link back to the documents. If you can't check the documents, then ultimately we're paging through everything again, and it's not an apples to apples comparison.
It's going to be a huge time saver for us to go through things more succinctly and identify gaps. I also really liked the feature where Supio can identify what's missing from your documents. They showed us something where if they were speaking to a particular doctor visit but we didn't have that medical bill, they would identify that for us so that either we upload it to Supio or reach out to our provider again. So the client is not left on the hook at the end of the case. Some of those technology aspects started to pique our interest and we thought, ""okay, I think we're looking at something different here.""
Drew: Those all were fairly high scores, but are there any areas that you wish Supio would improve or grow? Things that maybe aren't a problem but you could see value in and wish they did or incorporated from another tool?
Elyssa: These are two minor notes. As an administrator, we could use a few more permission access things. I had accidentally mistyped an email address and I wasn't able to edit that profileâ€”I could only delete the profile. From an admin perspective in most other software, I should have been able to edit the email address. I mentioned it to our account rep and she took care of it, but I would've preferred to do it myself.
And not an issue for us because we are who we are, but in the sales process, I think it's stylisticâ€”we got a lot of those emails saying, ""Hey, here's this promotion, it's going to end tomorrow."" That's not my preferred style. It's not threatening or off-putting, but it does put pressure on people. I know being a salesperson is difficult, but striking the balance between knowing someone's interested but not saying they're only going to get something if they act by tomorrow would be better. The person we were working with, Al, is wonderful, but it was a lot of those extra emails. Law firms are typically not that quick to make decisions.
Drew: Can I ask you one last set of one to five questions? These are feedback on the sales experience, one being a poor experience, five being excellent. How did Supio do on understanding your business needs and pain points in the sales experience?
Elyssa: Four.
Drew: How well did they communicate knowledge of Supio's product and capabilities?
Elyssa: Five.
Drew: How good a job did they do with communicating Supio's value proposition?
Elyssa: Five.
Drew: How would you rate the quality of product demonstrations and presentations?
Elyssa: Five.
Drew: And how was their responsiveness and timeliness in follow-up?
Elyssa: Related to my comments earlier, I'd say four.
Drew: Is there anything that's the most important thing you think Supio should focus on to improve their offering to better serve you?
Elyssa: No, not off the top of my head.",,,7/23/2025 3:50pm

An Interview with Tiffany Gary, Legal Operations Manager at Rocky McElhaney Law Firm


Transcript
Drew: Can you introduce yourself and explain your responsibilities at Rocky Law Firm?
Tiffany: Sure. Yes, Tiffany Gary. I'm the Legal Operations Manager here. It's kind of a unique role. I oversee all the support staff and resources that the firm uses, so all of the vendors that we contract with, I manage our case management software and everything that goes into that as well as our research and implement pretty much any sort of tool or resource that the attorneys or legal staff need. In a nutshell.
Drew: How did you find Supio?
Tiffany: Oh, it was at a SmartAdvocate conference. We transitioned to using SmartAdvocate. We went live a year ago, but we actually started going to the conferences and started setting up almost two years ago. And I think that's how we heard of Supio at that point. We had also had two different friends of the firm, attorneys at other firms had recommended them as well.
Drew: Were you actively looking for a solution at that point?
Tiffany: We were looking at what the market offered, so we weren't necessarily trying to solve a problem so much as trying to stay ahead of the curve and knowing what's available to us if we wanted to use it.
Drew: What criteria did you have as you started to see these different offerings in the market?
Tiffany: Because we didn't have anything we were looking specifically for, thankfully we didn't really eliminate anyone based off of one specific thing we had to have. We were just trying to see what was out there. I will say we have not ruled out using Supio. We just kind of put a pause on the process while we were going live with SmartAdvocate because changing a case management program is so much harder than learning a new one. So we were doing data conversion and all that, but really the things that we found that we eliminated other AI programs for were more operational than they were functional. So it was more like they're expensive or their pricing is confusing, or for us it's really important that anyone we partner with have a clear vision. And that was one of the pros of Supio, that it does seem like there's a good vision. It's got a good user interface and they have all in pricing, which are all things that honestly a lot of their competitors don't have.
Drew: As you evaluated these tools, was it your responsibility alone or did you have other people who you'd bring it to and get input from?
Tiffany: Typically, it's my responsibility to set them up and I sort of coordinate all the information that's coming in about what each one does. So I'm a part of all of it, but I would loop in different attorneys throughout the process as well. So I've always had an attorney with me on all of the demos that I've done, and mostly because I want someone there who can ask the questions I won't think of because I don't handle cases and I'm not an attorney, even though I babysit them a lot, I just want to make sure that the questions that they would think of are being brought to the surface in the moment. So I've had some of our newer attorneys rotating through them.
Drew: Which vendors remained in consideration that met your criteria?
Tiffany: We were looking at EvenUp very closely, and they partner theyâ€™re integrated with SmartAdvocate, their integration a little bit better with our case management program from what we saw. Now I know that Supio has done an update since we did the demo. I think we demoed last fall, and they've done a major update since then that we haven't seen. So the integration with SmartAdvocate may be better now, but EvenUp's was better, but we eliminated them specifically because of the pricing issue. They had a lot of their medical chronologies were separate from their sort of case analysis tools and you're charged differently for them, and it's very confusing and expensive. So even if we never use their medical chronologies, their case analysis alone was still comparable to Supio's fees. So it just didn't make sense.
Drew: What stood out in the comparison between Supio and competitors?
Tiffany: I don't think so. In terms of the offerings on the actual program were very similar. Just the way that they were priced out and managed by each company were different.
Drew: What makes Supio's technology platform and infrastructure appear robust and reliable?
Tiffany: I think honestly the design, how everything sort of in that dashboard, from what I'm remembering, it was a while ago, but the design was very easy to use and it had a lot of graphic visuals, which my team loves. And when you can use things like that, especially when you're looking at a medical chronology or things like that, anytime you can use graphics, especially if you can use them in trial, lawyers love that. But yeah, I would say specifically design and how it functions for me at least was really good. And then one of the attorneys that I've had in most of the demos, his name's Philip, he was most impressed by Supio's design as well.
Drew: What areas could Supio improve to better meet your needs?
Tiffany: No, honestly, for me, it would be more of like I would just need to see what they're offering now because it's been so long since we had a demo and there were a few things that I know they were working on. I would like to see how it played out.
Drew: What important industry events should Supio attend to connect with firms like yours?
Tiffany: So we go to the SmartAdvocate user conference in October every year. And because Supio does have an integration, that's a really good place to go. So that was good. I've met Ed there and he did our demos and then our marketing team actually met someone with Supio at the Legal Marketing Association conference that just took place in DC last week. And then we have several TTLA Tennessee Trial Lawyer Association conferences every year. And I know Supio has participated in those. So we've run into them at several conferences just this year.
Drew: What made your experience with Supio's sales team positive?
Tiffany: I mean, I don't have anything to complain about with the sales. I've dealt mostly with Ed Kirk and he's fantastic. He's just very responsive. He checked in way more than I answered, which I know was normal in a sales room, but for me it took an extra amount of patience. We were also trying to open a new office at the same time I was trying to research all this, so I was kind of a nightmare to deal with, which was very nice to be patient with me. But then also he was very transparent about changes that Supio was working on and in the new update and offering to demo again after the update that he offered us a trial to trial a case basically in the program, which for us specifically is a need. We wouldn't sign on with anyone we couldn't trial at least a few things in. So it was good. He listened. He was very attentive. It's been a good experience so far.
Drew: How important is human validation in AI case analysis tools to your firm?
Tiffany: They're both important. It just depends on to exactly what it's in reference to. So in terms of the tech, so human validation in the medical chronologies, I know EvenUp does a lot of that. That's a big component of their program, but not to put too fine a point to it, but you can get a medical chronology summary by uploading all your med records into an Adobe. At this point, AI is at a point where you could, if you want something to just put out information, you can do that. So the whole point is to have some validation in the process. So it's important, but it's not for us, it's not a deal breaker because at the end of the day, it adds cost. So if the validation adds cost to a point that it doesn't make sense for us to pay for it with the value of a case, then it's still going to be a no.
Drew: If you were CEO of Supio, what would you do to better serve a company like Rocky Law Firm?
Tiffany: I'll say just from a sales perspective, from our experiences with all of these different folks is we have a lot of face time with people from EvenUp or even we looked at Advanced AI as a different sort of AI. It's not like case analytics. It's a little bit different. So we looked at them and a couple other companies and they have folks in our area a lot. So for example, we've done dinners or they've done networking events or things like that. And I've never seen Supio do anything outside of those conferences. So they may be missing potential new clients by not doing things like that. I don't know, they're not missing us that way. But just in terms of general feedback, a lot of firms sort of expect that kind of experience or those, I don't want to be like you got to wine and dine 'em, but with attorneys you have to sometimes. So just having a presence in the market too of like, ""Hey, I'm going to swing by the firm and if you have questions, I'll be there to answer them. Otherwise I just want to shake your hand and walk on by."" We get a lot of that from the other platforms that we've just don't experience with Supio.
Drew: What other types of events should Supio consider?
Tiffany: Oh, I mean, EvenUp's doing a whole concert thing. They rented a suite at a Pearl Jam concert I think next week. And we've done, I think, Advanced, we did a Predators, Nashville Predators game, and they're like networking events, so they'll rent out a whole suite and invite a lot of firms to come. But those are really helpful too, because then as you're talking about Supio, you can also be talking about it with people who are currently users, which is very helpful to someone like me. I can ask all day sort of general umbrella questions to a Supio rep, but I'm going to get into the weeds with someone who's using it and it's more likely to put us at ease. So one of my attorneys went to an EvenUp event with me, I think it was just a dinner, but one of their users was there. And even though they didn't integrate with that user, didn't use SmartAdvocate, they were able to give shed a lot of insight about how they're using the program and how it's impacted their caseload. So it is helpful.",,,7/23/2025 3:50pm

An Interview with Melissa Jorgenson, Paralegal at Wm. Keith Dozier, LLC

Transcript
How did you come across Supio for the first time?
Keith did. And it could have been, you know, I had to check with him again. I think it was at a conference he was at, and it might have been the injury board conference. I'm not 100% sure about that. But he learned about it, talked to somebody that was there promoting their product, and then that person, I think is Lexie. I can't remember her last name. Followed up with him on some emails just to check in. And then we went from there.
Did you end up moving ahead with Supio?
No, we went with Supio. So this just happened in January, and I think Keith might have learned about it, and possibly it had to be no, no later than June of last year. So it was probably June. Between June and December. He had learned about it at a conference he was at. And so it wasn't a long time after he learned about it, that I think he got a few follow up emails. And then, of course, the AI industry starting to become more and more in everybody's front minds. Yeah, I guess that's a word forefront, I guess is a better word. So we did a he did a demo briefly, I think, and then because it's just him and I, sometimes we get super busy and time passes. And then we decided we had a couple we had a very large case that had like 8 to 10 plaintiffs in it that was going to trial and we needed some stuff done and decided we would just do it. And so we signed up for a year and started in January.
So it was the case that had a large use for this service that really motivated and triggered you to move ahead?
Right. Like in the past, with any type of medical record that records that we had, we had a great company that would do crons for us medical crons that you could link back to the medical page, but then you have to still search the cron and or the record for specific detail. And we needed something that we were able to communicate with the documents more directly. Now, you're talking to someone here that is old school. I'm in my 50s, and I still use paper sometimes. So when I say communicate with the document, I'm basically I guess I'm saying I generated type communication. So that's why we decided to dump, be able to dump all these records in and be able to get the Quran as well as ask it questions directly.
What types of questions are you asking it?
So the types of questions that we usually ask. And again we're very new to this. I'm still learning it. The program. And I'm learning that you have to be kind of precise sometimes. But I'll give you an example. We were at a mediation on Tuesday, and during the mediation our client was saying to the mediator here, here are all the things that I still have residuals from the injury that caused me. I have leg weakness. I, you know, when I sit down, it hurts. My knee has pain and she was just listing things off. So I got into Supio and I asked it, what were miss left leg complaints prior to this date, and it was. Or give me a I'm sorry. Give me a precise timeline of the complaint Miss Smith had regarding her left leg. See, I have learned how to word it, and then it immediately gave me her complaints, which, with any other product that we've used in the past, I would have to go and I could do, you know, left leg and search it page by page. But this gives me a quick timeline. So that's an example of how I communicate with Supio.
What do you think the main benefit to you is?
I think that the more I get to know how to ask it the right questions is extremely time saving. It's taken me quite a few back and forths with my rep to get to a point to where I know how to specifically ask it questions to make it time saving. But it's definitely time saving.
Did you evaluate any other tools that had similar capabilities?
I did not, but I can't speak for Keith. Keith is way more into the AI program. I know that there's been a couple that we utilize, with some deposition transcripts that we had for trial in February that are not necessarily a confidential, type based AI program, but I could not tell you what they are. And I think he was just playing with them to see what their capabilities were. And I think we learned that it was not a it was not a confidential base. Like once you dump some type of like literature into it, like, let's say you had a medical literature article that you wanted to dump into it and ask it questions. Then that became a part of the whole data bank that anyone could utilize through that program. But I couldn't tell you what it was.
It sounds like Keith wasn't necessarily searching for something when he met someone from Supio at the event. Is that accurate?
I would say I wouldn't say it was a true statement in the sense that I know he was more in tune to what AI could do, and he might have played around with figuring, you know, like, do I even want to try looking into AI programs or not? But I don't think he was actively like, I need to get an AI program. So I think that if you're going where I think you're going with this question is the fact that Supio put themselves out at this conference was the reason why we went in the direction of Supio.
What happened between that first meeting and going ahead that gave you enough confidence to move ahead?
Yeah, I think the features, he did like. I think the fact that he the conversation I think he had with the rep at the conference, he said he I remember him and this is just a conversation we had. He's like, I met this rep for this program. And it seemed pretty cool. She's going to send me an email. I'll look into it more and then I'll get your input and then like, time passes with us because we are. So it's just the two of us. And so and then I think like Thanksgiving hit, we both had the flu. And so again, it was just, we need a program. He had this conversation. Take a look at it, Melissa. Let me know what you think. And then I'm like, we I think we should give it a shot. Nothing in particular stood out other than we had heard it was good, and so we just gave it a shot because we had, like, eight plaintiffs in one case, and we're like, for the cost at 1500 for a year. We thought it was worth it. Because we could recoup that cost with one case. So I think it was just good timing. I think it was good timing. I think if we didn't have that one case, we might still be like, do we want it? Do we not want it type thing.
Can you tell me more about the pricing and packaging?
Yeah, I think we paid $1,500 a month, no matter how much we use it. And something about I have to look at my. And I'm not. This is what I'm not 100% clear on. And if I had any other criticisms I would say it's we have this $1,500 and it says like three cases medical mal is more you get so many clicks or something like that. Let me see if I can find it for you real quick. Oh, another thing that you don't really get a lot of. You don't get, like, this huge. Like, here's everything Supio's about. You have to ask. Like, I was like, how do you know how to do a demand letter? Oh, let me send this to you. And you're like, oh, okay. It might have been nice to have when we bought a 12 year subscription. Right. Like, but I did find that they're not maybe as old as the company as I thought they were. Okay. So you get things, like, included in your service as a timeline, packages, billing breakdowns. You get 12 months, 30 cases annually. 600 per single event, 1800, equal to three cases per medical malpractice or nursing home. And then it says fee 1500 monthly. And so it's very confusing. Like what does that mean. Like 600 per single 1800 per medical for three. But the fee is only 1500 monthly. So I never we haven't gone over 1500 a month. But I, you know, like one month I did dump in eight cases. So I don't know, to be honest with you. That's one thing that I'm kind of unclear on.
Would you say that the pricing is unclear? And how would you have preferred to pay it?
Yeah. No, I think paying the 1500 a month is not an issue. It's. We never know if we're going to go over that for some reason. It doesn't. It's not clear to me. Like if I dump for med mal cases in, what will I be charged? If I dump too many cases in. And then they have. I did confirm, though. I didn't, and it was a while ago that even if I dump so many cases in, it's still 1500. I'm not charged individually. And I got a response that that was true. But then when you look at our terms, it doesn't seem to read that way. So. That's it. I did, I did. Me and Keith did talk about ten days ago that I should probably get a better understanding. Of, you know, like, every time I do a deep dive or every time I ask, ask it to do a precise timeline I can. That's unlimited per case. So yeah.
Can you tell me about your perception of onboarding?
So onboarding and you'll have to excuse me, but that's like my first encounter where they tell me, here's the product, here's how you use it. Here's the best usage of the product. So, I on our part, we were in a huge rush situation where we had to get a bunch of stuff put into Supio, to get timelines done. And so we rushed admittedly, we rushed the onboarding. We were like, it was like 15, 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes of the first onboarding. And it was like, okay, you just got to give me the bare bones so that I can get these in there and get the timeline going. And then so that worked out well. But then my first rep that I had, I was communicating and I just wasn't getting what I felt was adequate, adequate responses back on how to do things. And then the product wasn't being done timely, like it seemed like when something they say takes seven days, it was taking, you know, 17 to 20 days. And then when I would ask why it wasn't done yet, I'd get a response that, well, I don't know what you're talking about. You just put it in. It was just kind of a mess. Right? So I talked to somebody about I hate to do it, but I think I need to change. I need a new rep. I need somebody that is going to be able to understand what I need better and have better responses. And so we did that like a month ago, and I got a new rep and he's been absolutely fabulous. And he does work with me and he's teaching me. And like I said, it's helping me understand how to use the product. And so there is a there's a huge difference in that sense. Like, I think if I had him from the beginning, I'd be way further along with my knowledge of Supio. So I don't want to say that onboarding was bad altogether because we did rush it as well. But it wasn't. It wasn't as thorough as I thought it would be. And I like I said, I have to ask, like I have to ask a lot of questions. It's not like it's easily like, oh, I could figure out how to use this part of it, or I can figure out what my limitations are or what they're not. I feel like I have to ask, like, can I do this? Can I not do this? It's not like I have this, like, handbook that walks me through things.
Please rate the following statements about Supio on a scale of 1 to 5. Supio's pricing was competitive and aligned with the value offered.
I don't know that. I don't know, because that's a key question.
Supio's values, culture overall approach were a good fit for our organization.
I'd say three.
Supio's product and service offer the key features and capabilities we needed to meet our requirements.
I would say three on that, too.
Supio's sales team effectively communicated the implementation process and their ability to deliver a smooth onboarding experience.
You know, I'd say four on that because the person who sold it to us was great.
Supio's technology and infrastructure appear robust, reliable and aligned with your technical requirements.
Can I say a four?
You gave a score of a three for company values, culture and approach. Can you tell me why? And what could have gotten them to a 4 or 5?
Yeah. I think it's just the way we started. I do, I think, like I was saying, we it's May, and we just started basically at the end of January, and it just was pretty rocky the first two months I had it. I honestly think if I had the rep I have from the very beginning, I would be able to be like, this has been fabulous.
You also provided a score of a three for features and capabilities meeting your requirements. How come on that one?
So we just did something this week. We tried to input a PDF that had some focus group data into it. And it doesn't appear that Supio is capable of giving Keith the outline that he needs. And so and he is really smart about AI type programs and he couldn't get it to do what it wanted. And I haven't been able to touch base with him yet on it to that point. But he decided to use a different program that he's used for focus group data before. It's an AI based program, I think. So we're finding that the limitations might be it's good for medical records, deposition transcripts and demand, maybe not the whole aspect of what we need at this point, but it could just be, again, a learning process for us. But we don't know because, again, we don't have, like, a guide, a manual to look at. We just have to try to figure it out first. And then if we don't know, then I have to ask the rep.
For these focus groups, was it a accuracy problem or a formatting problem or something else?
You know, I'll have to ask him. But here's another example. A demand package. I've asked it to do two demand letters in medical malpractice cases. And I do have an outline that I that they gave me once I asked, like, I don't even know how to begin to do a demand letter for you. You know, you guys say you do them, but I don't even know how to ask. And so I did get a like a five page pamphlet sent to me, but I don't still I'm still fuzzy on how I put in what level of demand letter I want and how I want it to read. Because even though I have like this pamphlet where it says you have level one, level two, level three, I don't know how to tell you necessarily use level one, but focus more on such and such. So there's little things like that that were like it works. It's just we're not sure if it's going to work the best for us. So my. I guess what I would say is that they, I think that they the one thing that I haven't had is that. Where you can look at something and be like, okay, I need to say this in the AI program to get what I want. Now it gives me examples of demand letters, but it doesn't tell me how to ask Supio to get that demand letter that way. Does that make sense?
You mentioned that you had a positive sales experience. Can you expand on that?
Yeah. What was so fabulous was, gosh. And I think her name was Lexi. I'm not sure. I don't know if you know the people at Supio, but for some reason, I think her name was Lexi, and she reached out to her and said, we have this huge case going to trial, and it goes to trial in four weeks, basically. Is there any way we could purchase and get things going now? And they just did it and it was a lot to ask. So that's where the I take the positive experience with them is they made it work. They were very communicative. They were right on getting everything set up.
So it was they matched your urgency and heard your need?
Mhm.
Was there any areas they could have improved?
Again, it was and I don't know if it's the I and I went round and round about even saying anything to, maybe it was Jennifer, Lexi and Jennifer. Anyways, that my rep, she was really sweet. She showed me how to get things downloaded, and but then about a week or so after we started, it just never went smooth until I got a new rep.
Is there anything that I failed to ask about your experience with Supio that is top of mind that they should know about?
No. Like, the only thing is, is that I, I don't know still to this day. What what Supio fully offers other than medications and asking asking it questions to produce certain things. I don't know if there's more to it than what I see on my screen. I'm starting to think maybe not that it's all just asking it questions. To create certain. You do have to cut and paste a lot with Supio. Like if you ask it, if you do a deep dive and you ask it to do like please give me a precise timeline of her reported complaints of her left leg. It'll produce that for you. But then you can't create a PDF from that. You have to cut and paste it into your own document, which is not a problem. So I'm just thinking, like, besides a demand letter, a timeline and a billing summary, that that's all Supio provides besides chatting with the document, but it could be that there is more, I just, I don't know. And again, it's because you don't get like a manual on the product.",,,7/23/2025 3:50pm

The Jeffcoat Firm
Drew Giovanoli (00:00:25 - 00:00:25)
 It. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:01:11 - 00:01:11)
 Hi. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:01:12 - 00:01:13)
 Hi. Jessica. How are you? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:01:13 - 00:01:14)
 I'm good. How are you doing? 
Drew Giovanoli (00:01:15 - 00:01:17)
 Good. Thanks for making time today. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:01:17 - 00:01:18)
 Of course. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:01:19 - 00:01:34)
 For context. My name is Drew Giovanoli. It's nice to meet you. And I run a research business. So I help other companies learn about their buyers, people who evaluated them, so they can improve. So Supio is my client. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:01:34 - 00:01:35)
 Okay. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:01:36 - 00:01:57)
 With your permission, we'll have a 25 minute conversation that's recorded and I just pull together learnings for Supio and I'll just guide you through the set of questions. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Can we start by just setting context so you don't mind introduce yourself and your firm and kind of your role there? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:01:58 - 00:02:25)
 Yeah. So I work for the Jeff Coat firm. We are In Columbia, S.C. we do about 50% of our caseload is personal injury and about 50% is criminal defense, with a total of about 3,000 cases. I am the business intelligence director, so anything technology and data related typically falls to me. So that is in part like all of the legal technology and inner workings and that sort of thing. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:02:25 - 00:02:31)
 Yeah, yeah. Amazing. And how big is the staff, the attorneys, and then the support staff? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:02:32 - 00:02:36)
 We have 80 total staff members with 11 of those being attorneys. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:02:37 - 00:02:45)
 Okay, great. And how did you come across Supio? Did you search for it? Did you stumble upon it? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:02:46 - 00:03:11)
 A little bit. I've stumbled upon it. So we're constantly looking to see who, which. Which legal tech companies are getting invested in and whether it is a fit for what we are looking to do. We tend to like working with startups and, you know, cutting edge groups, so we follow a lot of venture capital groups and that sort of thing. And Supio came across my radar. That's how we figured, found them. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:03:11 - 00:03:22)
 Great. And also for just context of the record, did you end up choosing to go with a tool like no tool at all? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:03:22 - 00:03:26)
 So we've been using Even Up. We were actually even up second client. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:03:27 - 00:03:28)
 Wow. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:03:29 - 00:03:47)
 So we've been using them, but we're always, I mean, look, the next best thing might still be out there. So whenever we see a new group come up, particularly in the AI space, we're willing to always give them a look and see if that, you know, like I said, the next best thing is the next best thing. Then we move on from even up. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:03:47 - 00:04:14)
 Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, great. Well, this will be a super useful conversation. I'd love to hear your experience evaluating Supio, kind of your perceptions of it, and in any ways you kind of could compare it back to even up, that would be really useful. So what was your. You found out about it and then did that lead to your own personal research or did you go straight to a sales call? What was the engagement like? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:04:15 - 00:05:46)
 So we did a little bit of research, but we, we were on a sales call with them pretty fast. So kudos to them for being responsive when someone asks for a demo. We have historically run about 90 to 95% pre litigation with only a small percent in litigation. And because of that, a big bulk of what we handle is typically just needing a demand drafted. Okay. So we're, I mean, Even up has been our sort of demand drafter for, you know, six, seven years. And when we looked at Supio, we, we could see value, but we saw it more as more complex cases on the litigation side. And truthfully, for our firm, that's not really the kind of cases we typically handle. So, you know, the product itself looks great, but we couldn't see how it made like, financial sense for us to make a change because it, you know, it's quite expensive. But for us, the average case value is, you know, a $25,000 limit settlement pre lit. And if we just need to pay for a demand, it doesn't really quite make sense for us to pay, you know, really much more than what we're paying now per case. So for us, it was a, a lack of seeing a value on the pre litigation side. Now, that is not to say that it doesn't exist, just that through our sales conversations, it wasn't made evident to us what that value was. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:05:48 - 00:06:09)
 Now Supio, like Even up does Demand Draft. What did you see in Supio that made you feel like it was either neutral or not as good as what you have today? Like, how would you kind of compare the demand draft? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:06:12 - 00:06:47)
 Some of it is we already had an integration built with our CRM, which is litify for Even Up. So when a case is opened, it's automatically pushing our stuff over. So that's helpful. They also used all of our templates to create our demands. Right. Now, I'm not saying Subio might also do that same thing, but the cost per case was significantly higher. It was almost three times higher for us than what we're paying Even Up. So what we're seeing is nearly identical functionality on the pre litigation demand drafting side, but the cost would have been much higher for us. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:06:47 - 00:06:55)
 Yeah, that's really helpful to hear. How is the cost structured for you at Even Up? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:06:57 - 00:07:49)
 So we pay per case and we pay. So now Even up is. It's a little different now that they have some Additional functionality besides just drafting the demand. But when we first started it was a again a per case basis. So like sometimes you send more than one demand per case but still just pay for one case case. So you might send a limits for liability, you might send a UIM, you might send a MedPay pip. All of those would kind of just be grouped under one case. It seems like Supio, at least from my recollection of that initial call, has a similar structure. It was just that like the per case cost was something like $100 for even up and around 300 for supio. So really close to the same functionality and just a higher price point. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:07:50 - 00:08:18)
 Sure. So let me repeat this back and make sure that I understand. Yeah, evaluated new tool because you're always looking for new things. Came across Supio functionality from the pitch seems to be nearly identical but you're paying a third less than they would charge and, and there's switching costs. You're already kind of embedded and set. It would have to not only kind of match but exceed what your current provider is doing in order to make the switch. Is that all correct? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:08:18 - 00:08:19)
 Yeah, that's all right. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:08:19 - 00:08:36)
 Got it. Is there anything that you saw that Scipio did that Even up might not do that you thought was a positive that they should keep in mind as. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:08:36 - 00:10:25)
 A differentiator the user interface is very customer friendly. So for us we have a, a lot of like trainings up front to get people comfortable using the Even up portal. I thought that Supio was a little bit more intuitive. It seemed like that you know, in terms of ramp up period of getting used to the product and how to use it and how to get the information you're trying to get. It's, it's pretty simple. So that's one thing that I even heard from our team that's like I'm not quite sure how do I know which demand type to select and Even up or my records are in there. But now I don't really understand where to find them now that they've pulled over. So like user interface was, was key there. I think that that would be helpful. Also their non demand document drafting is far superior to Even Up. So Even up sort of cut its teeth on demands and they've just, I mean just to the general public released AI docs but it's not necessarily something that's been trained on like litigation specific documents. Right. So like a summons and complaint for example, Supio would probably be able to produce significantly faster in a much better first draft then Even up and also Even Eve, like we, we also vetted Eve and Subio had the best, I would say out of the box litigation drafting. And again, for a firm like ours that's 95% pre lit, that's not necessarily that appealing. But for a lot of other firms that are handling a much larger percentage of litigation documents, that that piece of it I think is particularly important. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:10:26 - 00:10:32)
 Where do you think Even up stands out besides cost things that they do exceptionally well? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:10:33 - 00:11:14)
 So we've had a really good experience with their product management like development team. So like they literally come on site once a quarter and like meet with our team directly and they're like, okay, like what do you, like, what do you not? Like, what are you doing now that you wish could be automated or you feel could be automated? So like there's a lot of customer engagement that we appreciate and they've really taken some of our feedback and implemented changes that were really helpful. So really for us it's that level of interaction that we get not just with a customer success manager, but with the product development team directly. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:11:14 - 00:11:15)
 Got it. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:11:15 - 00:11:16)
 Yeah. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:11:16 - 00:11:24)
 How about with eve? What if things that you thought they do anything, they stand apart doing exceptionally well? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:11:25 - 00:12:12)
 No, we didn't like them. We were, we weren't impressed by the salesperson. We weren't like the product itself looks nearly identical to Sepio and we didn't like the people as much. So I know that's not like, there's nothing scientific about that, but we did not have a great sales experience. They were extremely pushy and we like didn't even feel like we could ask our questions. And then they were just essentially spent most of the call just kind of trash talking Even Up. Whereas like I would rather see what your product can do. I don't really care how you feel about your competitor. So anyways, there was, it was never a competition ticker for eighth. Like, we just did not have a good experience. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:12:14 - 00:12:44)
 Okay. I am curious in your interactions with these companies from like a marketing sense of where you're kind of exposed to them and aware of them. You mentioned even UPS coming on site every month. In terms of, outside of that, where are you seeing them? Are you at events, advertisements, Are they engaging with you in different ways? I'd love to hear how the different companies you come across. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:12:45 - 00:13:44)
 Yeah. So Even up does a monthly webinar where they have one of their client firms sit in and talk about, you know, a topic that is particularly important to that group. So like we did a webinar with Even up two months ago where we talked about like, how do you scale the number of demands you're sending without scaling the number of staff you have? That sort of thing. So they're pretty active in terms of engaging directly with their group. And those are live webinars. They also send out probably every other week. There's like a, you know, kind of a newslettery type thing. Like here's the most recent firm, what they did. That's great, that uses our product. Here's a new tool we're launching. Make sure you call your CSM to get access, that sort of thing. So there's quite a bit of interaction compared to some of our other legal tech vendors, even up is pretty active. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:13:45 - 00:13:49)
 Sure. Well, while we're touching on it, what other legal tech vendors do you use? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:13:50 - 00:13:57)
 So we use Litify as our CRM. We use foundation AI, we use Abstract, we use protocol. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:13:57 - 00:14:02)
 Like I'll do some research. Can you give me like the one sentence overview of each of them? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:14:02 - 00:14:57)
 Oh, geez. Okay. Yeah. So Proto Score is essentially a productivity tracker. It's similar to Active Track, but the difference is that it sits essentially inside of your Litify and captures like exact engagement with object, custom objects. Abstract is not technically legal tech, but they are a call center AI tool that we use to build essentially like a personal injury intake coach that sits live with our group. Let's see what foundation AI is. A document management tool. So essentially any physical mail, email attachments, faxes that come in are auto sorted into your CRM and named and like the notification goes out. I'm trying to think if there's any other biggies. I'm sure there is. I don't know what you use a lot of vendors. I'm sorry. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:14:58 - 00:14:59)
 Oh, no, that's cool. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:15:00 - 00:15:04)
 It's a lot of things to keep up with. Those are the big ones though. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:15:07 - 00:15:31)
 All right, tell me if you don't mind, about the, the way that the like decisions are made at your org. So you've got your role. I'm curious about who else like helps contribute to the decision, evaluates the tool, makes the final decision. Just like the workings of picking software at your company. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:15:33 - 00:16:16)
 So usually I am the one who sources it though we recently launched what we're calling our tech tribe, which is like a group of people in our firm that are interested in like participating in those decisions. So they can also bring new software tools, ideas to the group. Yeah, I do most of the initial vetting. If I feel like there's a use case, I typically bring in like the supervisor of the relevant department. So for supio that was the chief legal officer. Right. And so he also would do a demo, and then we would talk about, like, costs versus what we currently have. Does it meet the needs? And then usually I'll make a final recommendation, and our CFO will say yay or nay on the money. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:16:17 - 00:16:26)
 Okay, that makes sense. One thing I like to do about halfway through the interview is launch this little poll inside of Zoom, if that's okay. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:16:27 - 00:16:27)
 That's fine. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:16:27 - 00:16:46)
 To get your feedback on, there's two things. One is just your evaluation of Supio, and it's got, like, price, company alignment, functionality is just a one to five rating. Okay. Okay. Let me know if you have any questions, but it should pop up on your screen. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:16:46 - 00:16:47)
 Yep. I just thought. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:16:47 - 00:16:47)
 Awesome. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:17:11 - 00:17:12)
 All right. Just submitted it. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:17:12 - 00:17:24)
 Thank you so much. And then one more on the sales process, and then we'll talk about the sales experience. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:17:25 - 00:17:26)
 Okay. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:17:28 - 00:17:31)
 So one is poor. Five is excellent. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:17:31 - 00:17:52)
 Okay. Yeah. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:17:53 - 00:18:06)
 Great. So for even up, it sounds like they're achieving your goals of these demand drafts at a good price, and you have a good relationship with the people. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:18:07 - 00:18:07)
 Yeah. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:18:10 - 00:18:34)
 Supio aside is a question I always ask. If 12 months from now, you went with a different vendor, could be anybody. What. Why do you think that would be, like, so you put yourself in the future and look back, like, what's changed or what's happened in the relationship or any, like, existing concerns that maybe kind of grew that would make you change in the future. What's happened? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:18:35 - 00:18:59)
 I would say accuracy and speed. So for a demand, it's essentially running off a template. If I can get it instead of just a good first draft, but a nearly perfect finish draft and something that can be done within minutes as opposed to hours or days, then I think that's the. That would be a pivot point for us for sure. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:19:00 - 00:19:14)
 That's fantastic. Really good feedback. I think you. I believe you said two things. One was speed, and the other was accuracy. Accuracy, yes. It's together. It's. You get it to me, but also it's useless if you get it to me quickly and it's wrong. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:19:15 - 00:19:16)
 Exactly. Yeah. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:19:16 - 00:19:27)
 Yeah. On the sales experience. Sorry to go back, but is there anything that's obvious you think they can improve on from Scpio? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:19:28 - 00:20:37)
 Yeah. So I think that there's something. I feel like we missed something in terms of their value proposition. So obviously, there are other firms out there that have signed up and are using it for mostly pre litigation, and I don't feel like we. We saw what we needed to. To justify the cost. So I feel like there is probably something that they're doing exceptionally well because I've talked to other firms that are mostly pre lit and they use sepio very happily. But when we went through the sales process, I feel like we, we didn't get that type of value proposition from them. Like they focused really heavily on like sort of the non demand piece of it, like all of the other things you could do. And I, I'm just curious like if they could refine. For a firm that's mostly pre litigation, there's probably a different sales demo or tactic that could be taken that I think would make it a little bit more clear as to why the cost is that at that point and like how they're different than even up or even eve. I just feel like we didn't quite get that from them. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:20:38 - 00:20:46)
 Yeah, that's really good. This is a very good interview. You're very, you're very knowledgeable in this space. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:20:46 - 00:20:47)
 Very thoughtful. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:20:51 - 00:21:04)
 How about when it comes to learning about new tools, do you have any recommendations on where Supio should try to be? Whether it's events or continuing education. Anything that comes to mind. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:21:04 - 00:21:43)
 So I, I know that they have seen them. I actually spoke with one of the sepio people at one conference. Like we literally were on a panel together. I, you know, conferences are key. There's, I'm sure for their specific product. Like there is, there are like attorney list serves and places where they chat that like they are always bragging about like look at this cool new tool I got. I think like our South Carolina is like South Carolina bar forum or something like that. Like popping up in those places is really important because attorneys talk and they all want the next best thing. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:21:45 - 00:21:47)
 When you say list serve, it's just an email. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:21:47 - 00:22:22)
 It's. Yeah. And there's like a, you can like respond to it. I know our attorneys are constantly forwarding me something that they saw another attorney put in the South Carolina bar forum and it was in the email and they're like, well, why did this firm get to do this cool thing? We don't have it yet. I'm trying to remember what it's called though. Anyways, the point is anytime you can get in front of attorney, they're easy to impress on this kind of stuff. So you know, places where attorneys are speaking and congregating outside of conferences. So that might be cles, that sort of thing. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:22:23 - 00:22:34)
 These. Sorry to go back to it, but these list serves, are they formal and organized and you're like, because you're part of an association you put on it or Are they informal? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:22:34 - 00:23:53)
 Yeah, I think so. I think it's because like I think they're by state typically. So like I don't know what the ability to be like throw an ad in there is but anytime some I just know that the attorneys talk about them all the time and what they saw on it. So figuring out some way to get the bar to be in front of the bar association seems important on the attorney side. But that also might be through like you know, continuing education, like sponsoring something on that side. Webinars, we tend to like the webinars. We probably attend to several of those a month that different groups put on LinkedIn. Being very active on LinkedIn is, tends to be good. Our attorney see stuff on there and we'll screenshot it and you know, send it over. I think those are the key places that if I saw a Supio type product other than like I'm kind of odd in that I follow a lot of venture capital groups so like I see who gets invested in but I don't think most people do that. So. But yeah. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:23:54 - 00:24:02)
 Quick question about pricing. Do you pay upfront with like an annual commitment or is it a ongoing. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:24:03 - 00:24:29)
 Where we're on an annual year to year commitment. We have like a, a bucket of cases we expect to send a month and if we don't send sent like we don't use them all, they roll over. So like we started this year where we had like, like 50 cases that rolled over from last year. So they just like essentially we paid for them. So they reduced the cost for this year's contract by that much. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:24:29 - 00:24:39)
 Yeah. Would it encourage you to test out other software if that other software had a per usage cost? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:24:40 - 00:24:41)
 Yes, that definitely. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:24:42 - 00:24:50)
 So you think in a year if you were to switch because of accuracy or speed, it would also make a big difference if that was a per use trial. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:24:50 - 00:25:07)
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Any kind of like pilot or a program you could do where you essentially are saying I'm not going to fully commit to a year. I'm going to actually like make sure that this makes sense for us. Like we're going to get the right product that we want then. Yes. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:25:07 - 00:25:19)
 Cool. Have you found any? Sounds like your team's got a ton of great tech. How did you overcome the adoption challenges that a lot of other law firms face? 
Jessica Lockhart (00:25:20 - 00:25:30)
 So champion groups like teaching essentially a small group of people that we know have heavy influence on their peers. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:25:30 - 00:25:31)
 Yeah. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:25:31 - 00:26:26)
 And letting them kind of talk it up. We also talked a lot as a group and with our mid level managers about like how to actually use technology. Because what we had people doing probably like, a year ago is everyone would say, look, will you turn this product on? Why isn't it just fixing this problem for me? And so we had to, like, really teach our people to rethink how technology exists, almost like their co worker, as opposed to, like, a plug and play thing where, like, you wouldn't hire a new person and expect them to be perfect out the gate. You expect to have to train them and probably correct them and work with them. And once we sort of started getting people to rethink how to engage with technology, it seemed to help. So champions are key, really changing the way people think about technology and is part of our culture now. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:26:27 - 00:26:27)
 Yeah. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:26:28 - 00:26:30)
 So, yeah, I think that's helped. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:26:30 - 00:26:37)
 Awesome. Jessica, I love this interview. It was a great way to kick off the week for me. Thank you for all your time and knowledge. 
Jessica Lockhart (00:26:38 - 00:26:47)
 Of course. Of course. I'm always happy to answer questions. Like I said, we love some good tech, and it means that we all have to kind of help each other out and feedback is important. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:26:48 - 00:26:49)
 Yeah, sounds great.

Jordan Williams (00:00:36 - 00:00:37)
 Hey, good morning. 
Moderator (00:00:37 - 00:00:38)
 How are you? 
Jordan Williams (00:00:38 - 00:00:40)
 I'm pretty swell. How are you? 
Moderator (00:00:40 - 00:00:42)
 I'm great, thanks. I appreciate you making time today. 
Jordan Williams (00:00:42 - 00:00:44)
 Yeah, of course. Nice background. 
Moderator (00:00:44 - 00:00:46)
 Thank you. It's, it's real. 
Jordan Williams (00:00:46 - 00:00:53)
 I know for one, everybody has all these like automated fake backgrounds. I'm like, let me just see your dirty kitchen for once. 
Moderator (00:00:53 - 00:00:55)
 That's right. A little more human. 
Jordan Williams (00:00:55 - 00:00:56)
 Yeah. 
Moderator (00:00:57 - 00:01:19)
 Let me give you some context first. My name is Drew Giovanoli. It's a pleasure to meet you. I run a business called Barrier Wins and we research for businesses what their prospects and their customers think of them and their competitors and the whole market so that they can improve, so they can better serve their clients and earn new business. So Supio is one of my clients. 
Jordan Williams (00:01:20 - 00:01:20)
 Okay. 
Moderator (00:01:21 - 00:01:42)
 And so with your permission, we have like a 25 minute conversation that's recorded and used privately only for their internal use. It gets aggregated amongst, I think you might be interview 10 or 11. And we're trying to get to, I don't know, 15, 16, and the, yeah, be grateful. Kind of guide you through these questions and you share whatever you're comfortable with. 
Jordan Williams (00:01:42 - 00:02:34)
 Yeah, I, I, I'm a big proponent of providing feedback to people and businesses. So I do this pretty often. So I'm happy to, to help them because they were well recommended and they're, well, you know, they're so we're in Florida, we're a Florida based firm. We always use our resources like the fja, the justice association, the Tampa Bay Trial Lawyers Association. We go to our partners that we are members of or other people who are members in those groups to get, you know, feedback. And so that's how we found Supio to begin with. They were, you know, a recommended partner per se, which some places you can pay to be. But when other firms were using it, we were getting examples and feedback from other firms on how it's helping them. Then, you know, that's how it came to a fruition to, you know, interview, meet with them and see what they had to offer. 
Moderator (00:02:35 - 00:02:46)
 Great. Well, let's get some context set. So I make sure I ask you the most relevant questions. Can you just introduce yourself and your role at the firm? And maybe you share the size of the firm as well, like number of attorneys and support staff. 
Jordan Williams (00:02:47 - 00:03:48)
 Yes, I am the director of operations and I report only to the owner. Everybody else reports to me. So I oversee everyone and everything that lives and breathes, all of our properties, all of our facilities as well. I've been in this industry for probably a decade. I used to work on the insurance side, on the claims side, before coming to the legal side. And we have about 35 employees. We do some, you know, internships. We have six attorney teams which include a paralegal, a litigation paralegal, or a litigation paralegal, a litigation scheduler, and a medical records coordinator. We have a marketing director now and then, you know, a bookkeeper. And well, we probably have four, five legal assistants who do you know, our service email, who do floating paralegal work, stuff like that. 
Moderator (00:03:48 - 00:04:01)
 Great. And is it your role to evaluate, investigate new softwares like Supio? Does it come from kind of all around the firm and you're the final decision. How does that flow of decision making work? 
Jordan Williams (00:04:02 - 00:06:28)
 Both. So both in the sense that come I start it and I finalize it. So I'm the one that evaluates the needs and the, the wants per se. I'll get feedback from staff. Oh, gosh, this process just sucks. Well, how can I fix this? How can I automate this? And that's pretty much what led us to Supio. We currently have our medical coordinators, medical records clerks, who, you know, get all of our medical records, all of our bills, past, current, you know, and what are future as they come. They create medical portfolios manually through Adobe. And so they manually bookmark thousands of pages. Very time consuming. Right. And so insert, super insert, you know, other companies who have AI, medcrons or Med summaries. And so I consulted with some of my other buddies who own firms, other administrators. You know, I'm in nationwide marketing and networking groups that I present at. And I actually offer, you know, software options that I've used and I've had success with. And some people have used Supio and they love it. Some people have used it and they didn't, you know, some people have used File Vines, which is our case management software. Filevine had their own AI and it was trash. And so Five Nine recently acquired a new company and they're scrapping their own whole AI that they built and they're just bringing on this new company altogether. And it was a company that Subio lost to ultimately. Formerly known as Parrot. Parrot originally started as a core reporting software company. An AI core reporting software or an online quarter quarter. And then it branched out into deposition summaries from AI and then into the Medicron reviews and. And portfolios basically is what we call them. And so they were one of our contenders. Supio was a contender. And then our other contender was Expert Institute, because we already use them for expert searches and expert radars as they Call it. And so the idea with Expert Radar or Expert Institute. Oh, nice. We already pay them for one service. Let's keep it all in one platform. Then it all communicates. 
Jordan Williams (00:06:28 - 00:09:44)
 The expert can now see the medical records and Metronology. But they made some significant changes from when we first started looking at their document to when we were finalizing our decisions. And we the layout of their document does not align with our needs. Our ultimate choice was Parrot, AKA now medcron by filevine. And that integration to file line is happening right now between the two companies and then we'll pick up on them. But Supio absolutely love the features. But again, it's another platform for our staff to have to go to to do things. And it's only a platform. The biggest quarrel that we had, and I shared that with Ed possibly I think it was his name. Great guy. It's all online and only online. And so when we're going to trial and the purpose of our documents, our med chronology is a living, breathing document throughout the life cycle of the case. So we need something a that has a quick turnaround time, not three to six days to happen. The turnaround time was a big detractor from SEO. We need things to move much quicker. An amazing feature that they did have was the billing option, which nobody else has yet. So we will still manually do our billing portfolios, but we'll have so much other, you know, so much free time. After transitioning to the medical portfolio, the Med cron AI Supio could not create a downloadable form for the record summary that the system creates. That was the number one reason why we immediately said no. Because if they did have that function, we probably would have said yes. Of course, them being able to integrate into our case management software would have been a plus. But because there was no integrations and no ability to download the document to see as a whole and take that to trial. Because we have to print these out in binders, right? We print these out for our reference. If we don't have Internet in a courtroom or something happens, then what do we do if it's all online? So that's how we see it. So our these Med crons, as we call it, are, you know, living and breathing throughout the entire life cycle of the case. Now we don't provide this to everybody. This is more internal for our trialminders, but this is what we use for quick reference and mediation, things of that sort. And so when we have an attorney in mediation, for example, they're arguing our clients, you know, medical records and medical Bills and findings, comparing them to, you know, past findings to differentiate, you know, the values. At mediation, they already have Zoom open. They already have our case management software open. You know, they, they can't be juggling between 12 different platforms trying to figure out what's what or who's who. So that's kind of the, the big detractor for us as well. But I'm sure you have a slew of questions. So now that my rant's over, I'll let you take it. 
Moderator (00:09:44 - 00:10:18)
 No, you make my job easy. Let's continue on this chain. I will come back to early marketing stuff. Like you said, you're going around the country, you're sharing your learnings, you heard about the different conferences. So I'll come back and touch on that. But while we're on the thread of like learning from Supio, you shared a lot about strengths and weaknesses. You went with Parrot, Slash, File, vine, speak to me about them. What do you think they do? Exceptionally well. What do you think some of their weaknesses are? 
Jordan Williams (00:10:20 - 00:13:06)
 Who? Well, what we thought were weaknesses, you know, in actuality were just parameters that could easily be changed or altered. They initially will build out and this could change because they're integrating with filevine. This is filevine's MO to go and secure these companies. So Filvine tried the A on their own. They significantly failed. They're going to go buy a company now to be able to offer their service as a wholly owned service, you know, which from a case management software standpoint, heck yeah, why don't, why would we not want to offer all these amazing services to our clients? So they now that Parrot is going to be integrating with Filevine, what I would go, when I would go to parrot.com or whatever the website is, when I would go to parrot.com, that platform view we like that will now be mirrored in the case management software, which is incredible. Parrot, you can download the documents. The documents have hyperlinks, they have back buttons to go back. So if you're on page 200 and you're looking at a doctor's visit and you now want to see the actual doctor's bill, which is page 2000, you can easily flip back and forth without having to remember where you were. Great job at summarizing. You can download the document in a short, a detailed or non detailed form with bills, without bills, with records, without records. You can do it by provider, by facility, by date of service. So even just from a download view, you probably have, I don't know, 30 different options to download the document the way that you want in their process time. I had 11,000 records processed in less than 24 hours and summarized in less than 24 hours. Incredible. Their software also detects duplicates and will not charge you for duplicates, which nobody else can touch right now. Because a lot of times what happens is we will have a medical authorization from our client to request a record for records from a doctor. Right. But if an attorney subpoenas the doctor for our client's file, they're going to get more than we would get with a regular medical authorization. And so we will get that from OC because we request that. And if we upload that to Parrot, for example, it will pull out only what is new and add that in instead of charging us for 100 pages when there's only four new pages. Right? 
Moderator (00:13:07 - 00:13:07)
 Yeah. 
Jordan Williams (00:13:07 - 00:15:38)
 Other people couldn't do that. And I believe that was the case of Supio. I could be wrong. Parrot originally told us that there was a page limit. That was a lie, which I don't know why they would do that. It was a lie. He's just, you know, they have a, they don't sell that. They can handle an unlimited amount of documents. If it's over a certain amount, then they're like, hey, give us a heads up so we can make sure, like we can get it taken care of in a timely fashion. But they have examples where they handle for auto insurance carriers that have hundreds of thousands of pages to be uploaded at one time. So that's cool. But because like I said, it's a living, breathing document. With Parrot, it if we get a bunch of records in at once, because we order records every month, it only takes an hour or less than 24 hours to get the new updated summary. And we can look at the prior versions too, which is even better. And then we can also look to see what is new, what's not new. If we upload duplicates by accident. And then when you download the document into Adobe, it's still like a fully functioning and living document, which is great with all the hyperlinks, examples, filter capabilities, bookmark abilities. And because the way that the document is downloaded, it's much more user friendly for software platforms to be able to access it and use it. The main reason why we're doing what is it we are all of our medical portfolios, we can't save in filevine because we lose the bookmarking capability. So because these parent document has hyperlinks, we don't need bookmarking. We have a search function before the Integration, we have a search function, the hyperlink function, and it just boom, boom, boom, move really quickly. Once it's integrated in the file line, it's going to cake because now all we need is file line and zoom open for, you know, for our meetings and everything's right there. So ultimately, you know, the ability, and there's a million case management platforms out there, but the ability to integrate or have some form of integration is, I mean, just a massive proponent in my opinion. 
Moderator (00:15:40 - 00:15:47)
 You mentioned at the beginning that what you perceived as weaknesses were maybe configurations. 
Jordan Williams (00:15:48 - 00:15:48)
 Yes. 
Moderator (00:15:48 - 00:15:50)
 Can you speak a little bit more to that? 
Jordan Williams (00:15:50 - 00:17:02)
 Yeah, definitely. So, I mean, they were settings, right. They told us originally 7K was the max on pages. I'm like, well, our Test project is 11,000. They're like, oh yeah, no problem, we can do that. And I go, what do you mean? He's like, oh, well, we just publicly say that this is generally the max, but we can tweak it based on your account, we can make adjustments. And so I always get references when I am dealing with new companies. So he provided me references at Travelers Insurance opposing, you know, other opposing counsels for in house counsel, other paralegals, other attorneys. So I probably spoke to three or four people that Parrot, you know, provided me references for. And, you know, there's always a little bit of that, you know, initial onboarding, but they work with them to understand their exact needs for the firm and what they wanted. And they were able to make sure that their platform, you know, exceeded at that. Since the time that I originally interviewed with Parrot months back, we were just very busy with trials and whatnot. This kind of felt to the wayside a little bit. 
Moderator (00:17:02 - 00:17:02)
 Yeah. 
Jordan Williams (00:17:02 - 00:17:54)
 Then we picked it back up. Parrot went from here to like here. As far as what they offered, I mean, it's like they took a bunch of steroids and got jacked up. And that's just because they took so much of their user feedback to and implemented it in a great and positive way. Whereas Expert Institute, they took their feedback from their stakeholders and it, in my opinion, significantly impacted their product. Their original product, they were going to be our number one. But once we realized they changed it and their new product, that document that their system creates, not great. They're also a four to six day turnaround time. Even though they have medical professionals that review the documents, there are still errors, there's still issues. We've seen the least errors and issues with, you know, parent, AKA med Cron by Bob. I know. 
Moderator (00:17:56 - 00:18:13)
 The changes they made. Do you think that they are good For a specific use case perhaps like what do they build towards? Obviously they're not trying to build away from clients, but they, what do you any, any idea of what they were building towards? 
Jordan Williams (00:18:15 - 00:19:24)
 I'm trying to think about how to say this ultimately more user, you know, end user UX experience is what a lot of, a lot of their, you know, document changes were. Their system is very simple. You create the case matter, you upload. You can upload the police report now. It will compare the injuries to the facts of the loss, you know, from the police report. It kind of creates not just a medical summary, but like an overview of the case almost based on what you upload. So you can upload a little bit more than just the medicals now, which is pretty cool. And so it'll help identify that, you know, in most rear end collisions you tend to experience, you know, these types of conditions which client John Smith has experienced, stuff like that. The summaries are much more fruitful versus just like so and so was injured in a car crash, hurt back, hurt neck, you know, cut and dry, which is how a lot of these are great. 
Moderator (00:19:25 - 00:19:51)
 Let's jump to the marketing side of things. I guess marketing from the sense of a, of somebody like file vine or Supio. From your sense kind of an education and networking and sharing standpoint. Could you tell me a little bit more about you participate in sharing kind of information you've learned in, in different marketing areas around the country. Tell me more about that, if you don't mind. 
Jordan Williams (00:19:53 - 00:22:34)
 Yes, so I guess you could call them networking groups or events. I've always been a big proponent for those things. I enjoy going to conferences, FJA conferences, summits from partners. You know, fja, which is the Florida justice association, every state has one. California would be the CJA for example. You know, those are basically peer meetings and whatnot. And so I've connected with partners through their. I have monthly like working operational groups that I'm a part of through Injury Board that is a lawyer referral connection service. So you basically are a member there and other firms can find other firms in other states to send cases to. Right. So if you're in Georgia, you're not licensed in Florida. Let me go to Injury Board and find who's licensed down in Florida, who's a part of this group. You know, a lot of these groups, like our local groups, Tampa Bay Trial Lawyers association, for example, you have to be admitted through a unanimous decision by the whole group. Right. So some of these groups are pretty elite and it's kind of the top tier. So we have top tier performers providing recommendations or you're speaking to them, you know, regarding your functions and operations. Those are, you know, the kind of avenues and venues that I get in front of. I mean I even help some of these companies and other people with like, almost like free like operational advice they'll send me. Hey, here's a build out for our new website. Give me your thoughts and I'll, you know, nicely rip it apart just so that they're aware. But I've had a lot of experience on the marketing side to myself because at some of my prior firms, I mean we were big box, right? We're competing with Morgan and Morgan, we're competing with our other local firms, you know, multimillion dollar monthly marketing budgets, you know, so you got to make sure you allocate your time and your resources, but you can still be successful about spending that much. And so a lot of people, they're just not familiar with it. So yeah, I like to participate in marketing. Monthly marketing, monthly operations with injury board and then I've been asked to speak at, you know, bar association events. I've been on the radio for it. I've been on the news for it. Just business news, business, you know, talk. A lot of attorneys that I met over the years that go to other firms or they start their own and then I'll come in and you know, talk to their staff or meet with some of their teams and things like that. Awesome. 
Moderator (00:22:37 - 00:23:05)
 No doubt you have to have a great product and serve your clients well. But putting that aside, if like kind of the products were equal, what do you see those companies? What do what, what do you see people doing well to engage with the legal ops community right at those events or through any associations or continued education. What do you think the best in class does give me? If you don't mind giving examples. 
Jordan Williams (00:23:05 - 00:24:16)
 Oh gosh, that's like asking me why people are antisocial or not social. I think what behooves people or companies, A company should allow their key stakeholders, internal stakeholders, to meet other like minded people within their field. You know, most people do not allow their staff to go to an operations event or a summit. Injury board, you know, for example, they're big on operations, they're big on marketing. They have other meetings too, just for attorneys to be able to meet. And they bring everybody together. I think that's great. They have two summits a year, I think, and then all these monthly, you know, monthly meetings to check in, go whenever you want. No big deal. A lot of other companies don't do that. Right. You pay to be memberships, you know, a member with some of these companies and they're just like, oh yeah, we just have a bunch of, you know, cool corporate discounts you get. Right. High five. That's great. But you know, you. 
Moderator (00:24:16 - 00:24:56)
 Can I pause you. Sorry, Jordan, if you don't mind, I just want to pause your stick to make sure. Specifically I'm looking for like, what is filevine or Supio or even Upper Eve doing to participate with these communities that you think, like, what are they? What is best in class in your perspective for them? We've heard everything from like they're getting boxes at hockey games and stopping into your office every other week to participating in cles, to sponsoring events. Like in your mind, what has any impact? What do you think is useful, positive? What do you think people are doing well out there? 
Jordan Williams (00:24:57 - 00:26:58)
 I mean, going to the. Participating in these summits, like having a booth at these summits or these events is important. A lot of our other stakeholders, you know, they will say, hey, we're going to this conference. Would you like some free tickets? Since, you know, you part art, you know, you work with us, or if you're looking to go, we can give you some free tickets and we'll take you to dinner. Standard kind of business networking there, in my opinion. I would like to say that majority of the software companies that we end up using, I find. So I think it would be beneficial for them to, and I'm sure they do this for the most, most part, but reach out to firms in different areas if they're looking to expand their market or, you know, their market share somewhere contact firms directly. Like good old fashioned virtual door knocking. Might pick up the phone. Yeah, don't really get a lot of that. I would honestly prefer that. Do I get annoyed when people walk in and want to talk to me? Yes. But even if I'm busy, I would probably be more inclined to follow up with somebody who attempted to meet me than somebody who just called. Right. Very impersonal. Sure. Do we love box tickets to hockey or baseball? Absolutely. But that usually is. I usually turn those down because I'm like, let's just figure out if we're going to work together or not. If we work together, then we can celebrate with a game. I'm trying to think, yeah, like for example, our process server, they're a nationwide company, proof serve, our rep is amazing. I did find them, but I do feel valued. After we have, you know, use their services, they come to local conferences they always invite us, they send us, you know, thank you gifts. They check in on me, which is nice. I'm always checking in on other people and so it's nice to have the table turn in that regard too. 
Moderator (00:26:59 - 00:27:26)
 Awesome few minutes left and this has been a phenomenal conversation by the way. One of the. There's a range of quality of feedback I get in these and this is top tier. What have I not asked about in terms? We talked a lot about kind of product strengths, weaknesses of Supio versus filevine, some of these new products and marketing. If my job is to get as much valuable information for Supio to improve both their product, their service and their go to market, what have we talked about that they could learn from? 
Jordan Williams (00:27:28 - 00:29:02)
 We have not talked about presentation of Supio's product. The demonstration. Ed is very nice. He was great with follow up, checking in. Very good. Not too much, not too little. But I will say the presentation overall could probably have been a little bit better. And I'm going to use adp. We recently switched to ADP as a reference. Right. We switched to ADP and they show me how to do what I need to do in the system. They did not show me what happens in different circumstances or facing other obstacles. You know. So when I get a survey from adp, which I should be getting soon, about the implementation process, I'm going to say that the educational and training side is underwhelming. Sure, you show me how to run payroll and add somebody to the system, that's great. But for a platform that's so powerful, you know, it's like I just feel like I was showing the basics. I'm not sure if that would have, you know, swayed our opinion on our decision. I think the features currently are not something that was will be offered in the near enough future for us to wait to use Supio. But I just feel like the presentation in my opinion was a bit spotty. Great. And I think Ed's high up in the company and sometimes we have our good days and our bad days. I don't think it was a bad day, but that's probably my only feedback. Great. 
Moderator (00:29:03 - 00:29:17)

Moderator (00:01:11 - 00:01:51)
 I run a research company that seeks to help my clients learn how they can improve, how they can better serve their customers, and how they can earn the business and new prospects. And we do so by having a short conversation with folks like yourself about how they. The pain points they're feeling and the why they considered cpo, why they consider other people and just learning. And so, with your permission, we record a 25 minute conversation interview and aggregate it also alongside 15 other interviews to give them learning as to how they can improve and then get compensated for your time. Awesome. 
Bridget Smith (00:01:51 - 00:01:52)
 That sounds good to me. 
Moderator (00:01:52 - 00:02:04)
 Great. If you don't mind, let's start with just some context settings so I can ask you the right questions and make sure I know everything about you. Could you start by introducing yourself and your role at your firm? 
Bridget Smith (00:02:06 - 00:02:12)
 Sure. My name is Bridget Smith and I am the Chief Strategy Officer at Ridgers Rutgers of Nakajima. 
Moderator (00:02:13 - 00:02:16)
 Great, thank you. And how many attorneys and support staff. 
Bridget Smith (00:02:16 - 00:02:22)
 Does that firm have altogether? We probably have just under 50 employees. 
Moderator (00:02:22 - 00:02:27)
 Okay. And is it an even split of attorneys and support staff or something different? 
Bridget Smith (00:02:27 - 00:02:36)
 There's a few more support staff than there is attorneys. I'd say the attorneys are probably. We're sitting right at around 20 right now, and then everybody else's support staff. 
Moderator (00:02:37 - 00:02:39)
 Great. And to confirm, you evaluated Supio recently? 
Bridget Smith (00:02:40 - 00:02:40)
 Yes. 
Moderator (00:02:41 - 00:02:42)
 Great. And did you end up going with Supio? 
Bridget Smith (00:02:43 - 00:02:43)
 We did. 
Moderator (00:02:44 - 00:02:57)
 Okay, great. Let's start from the very beginning. What was the pain point that led you to Supio in the first place? And did you find them or did they reach out to you? How did that all occur? The start of it. 
Bridget Smith (00:02:58 - 00:04:15)
 The start was myself and our operations manager, Caitlin, went to the Fireproof conference and we had filevine as our case management system at the time. We had been struggling with filevine for several months at this point, and then also at that conference realized there were other people struggling with filevine. We also had just kind of within filevine, had signed up for their AI usage and it hallucinated on us and it took a long time to fix, so we weren't super happy with that. And while we were at the conference, there were four different AI companies that, you know, they had a panel going, and Supio actually was not my number one coming out of the panel. But then after doing, you know, demos and research on them and you know, going through the process with them, I liked their product the best. And then kind of I left it pretty much in our team's hands and I was like, hey, tell me what you like. You're. You guys are going to be the ones using it. And they really liked the capabilities that Supio had, so we pulled the trigger and went with them. 
Moderator (00:04:15 - 00:04:20)
 Awesome. Who was your favorite out of the initial panel and why? 
Bridget Smith (00:04:21 - 00:05:21)
 Eve was my favorite coming out of the panel. They really seem to have like a good grasp on things and I think better explained what the platform was for and what it does. But then we did actually do a two week demo with them and my team really liked it for the most part. But then after we demoed with Supio and kind of compared them side by side, there was more that Supio offered. Eve was in the works on getting some of those things and I liked the more hands on approach that Eve had with letting us demo the product for two weeks and letting us upload as many cases as we wanted and things along that line that really helped. But eventually we just decided, hey, there was, there was one aspect of Supio which was the billing specials kind of breakdown that they allowed, which was the kind of main point why we went with them. 
Moderator (00:05:22 - 00:05:36)
 Great. Let's talk about the hands on approach that you really liked from Eve. You mentioned there's a two week trial. You can upload as many cases as you want. I'm just digging a little bit more about why that works and what you liked about it. 
Bridget Smith (00:05:39 - 00:06:26)
 We were able to, our team was actually able to just kind of log into Eve and use it. With Supio, we kind of just gave them a file and they put it all together and kind of spit it back out at us. But our team wasn't able to actually use it or play with it at all. And I think for user adoption, it's a lot better when you have your team actually working with and you know, like being able to figure out all the functionality on their own and maybe with some training here or there, versus being like, hey, we like this functionality. It seems to work. They made it work here, you do it too. So I. The demo trial period with Eve was really nice. 
Moderator (00:06:27 - 00:06:38)
 How did Supio earn your trust? It sound like they have some capabilities around billing, which we'll talk about, but somehow they overcame that obstacle. How did they. 
Bridget Smith (00:06:40 - 00:07:42)
 I think I had my team in on meetings with them and it was, it really was the billing spreadsheet that we do that or had been doing it previously manually for 40 years and so with just being able to like drag and drop things into Supio and it spit out the numbers now, actually it's not currently working, so that is a frustration because that's the whole reason we went with them. But it being able to like have the capability and I'm sure the kinks will get worked out, it'll be fine. Um, but having that ability to do that was. They were just amazed by it. And they were like, no, I love this. They also liked the talking across the case with the AI assistant seemed to give better output than EVE did. And so that's why they were like, yeah, I like this system better. And you know, their system works. I mean, clearly, you know, even without the demo, we still chose them. So. 
Moderator (00:07:43 - 00:07:43)
 Yeah. 
Bridget Smith (00:07:43 - 00:07:46)
 Or without the hands on demo, I guess I should say. 
Moderator (00:07:46 - 00:07:52)
 What. What's not working about it now? I'm sure you've communicated to them, but at a high level what's not working. 
Bridget Smith (00:07:52 - 00:08:30)
 So I guess when they drag and drop the bills in, it's not reading all of the codes and stuff properly. So it's not exactly saying there have been adjustments, there have been write offs, there have been payments that is showing up blank. So we're actually ending up like several hundred dollars and sometimes several thousands of dollars short. And then the editing within, like we can't go in and like manually edit. So say it gives us part of the information. We can't just go in and edit it to make it say the right information. 
Moderator (00:08:31 - 00:08:47)
 Yeah, that makes sense. Let's talk about the sales process for Supio. You mentioned that there was a demo process. It wasn't hands on. Can you walk me through your perspective of that experience, how it was for you, positive and negative, where it could improve? 
Bridget Smith (00:08:49 - 00:10:10)
 Yeah. So they said, hey, do you have a file? And we'll upload it and we will give you what it looks like for the demand and the medical chronology. And then we can, once that's all been prepared and ready, we can jump on and we can show you what it provided and you know, do some real time stuff with your team. So I said, great, we did that. It was lovely. It was something we already had a demand out on and it was something. It was one that we had a demand done through eve. So we were able to kind of see like what our process is versus Eve's process versus Supio. And the demand that Supio prepared was a little bit higher level than what EVE had prepared. And I also liked the way that they have attorneys review things prior to sending it to us. I Don't. Eve is not one that does that. I don't believe. And so we all sat down, you know, on a Zoom together, and then we were able to. They kind of just shared their screen while we, you know, threw different things at it, saying, like, hey, can you add two paragraphs to. To, you know, pain and suffering here or there? And we're able to in real time kind of see how it worked. So that was their. 
Moderator (00:10:11 - 00:10:12)
 Yeah. 
Bridget Smith (00:10:12 - 00:10:12)
 Demo process. 
Moderator (00:10:13 - 00:10:21)
 When you say higher level, what do you mean by that? Do you mean there were less details or do you mean that it was more strategic? 
Bridget Smith (00:10:22 - 00:10:43)
 I guess the way. Just the wording in general, the writing was a little bit better. The way that it put together. The injury portion of the package seemed a little bit more cohesive and better written. 
Moderator (00:10:44 - 00:11:02)
 Got it. Before you, like, fully engaged with both Eve and Supio, did you have a set of criteria that you came up with, your team came up with on, like, how you were going to judge them and even if it was informal or not written down, what were the things that were important to you? 
Bridget Smith (00:11:03 - 00:11:34)
 We did not. We just knew we didn't like what we currently had because it was. It was very slow. So we wanted to. I guess that could be criteria. We didn't want it to take forever, and we didn't want it to hallucinate. So that's about all we had based on what our current knowledge base was and what we currently had going. Because our. Our initial introduction with AI had just been with filevine and that had only been very, very recently, so we didn't have a lot of AI experience. 
Moderator (00:11:35 - 00:11:48)
 Got it. If you don't mind, I'd love to launch a poll survey inside the Zoom for you to answer some questions. Try to get some data like that. Let me know if you see it. 
Bridget Smith (00:11:48 - 00:11:50)
 Yep, I see it. 
Moderator (00:11:50 - 00:11:58)
 So it's just a ranking of 1 to 5. 5 being strongly agree on how you would rate these statements about Supio. 
Bridget Smith (00:11:58 - 00:11:59)
 Okay. 
Moderator (00:12:23 - 00:12:31)
 Awesome. And I'm going to launch one more while we're in the motion of it, about your sales experience. 
Bridget Smith (00:12:33 - 00:12:33)
 Okay. 
Moderator (00:13:02 - 00:13:19)
 Great. Now, you mentioned already what that billing was a FE standout feature that Supio had that Eve did not. Were there any features that filevine or Eve had that Supio did not that stood out as valuable or you wish that Supio would build? 
Bridget Smith (00:13:22 - 00:13:44)
 No. One of the reasons we went with Supio was just because it had. It had everything the other competitors had and then some. And so that's what we were like. From my standpoint, I'd rather pay a little bit More and have a better product than pay less and still have to do manual stuff or still have to do the extras on our own. 
Moderator (00:13:45 - 00:13:54)
 Sure. Is there anything that none of the products had that you wish Subio would build? 
Bridget Smith (00:13:57 - 00:14:29)
 That's a good question. Off the top of my head, no. Just because I myself am not like, super in the tech world. So trying to figure out what it is that we could automate that, you know, they could do is probably a little bit out of my element. But. Yeah, not. Not off the top of my head. But I know we've talked to them about, you know, various things that they are. They're like, oh, we're already in the process of this. 
Moderator (00:14:30 - 00:15:18)
 Oh, cool. At a company your size and who's using super, they tend to also have other tech providers do all sorts of things. One thing we're interested in is learning. What do you. What is kind of best in class, in your view of how vendors engage with the legal community? So when I ask that, we've heard, you know, participation in events, there is just more social, like dinners or concerts or sporting events. There's participation in continuing learning and education. I guess they're trying to decide, you know, how much do they invest in that area to, you know, engage with the community. What have you seen companies do and what do you think? Yeah, what do you think is done? 
Bridget Smith (00:15:18 - 00:15:52)
 Well, I would say the more of the, like, conference type stuff the two, our two partners are, they're younger guys and they both have, you know, small kids. And so getting them to, like, go to a concert or a ball game or something later in the evening is just not super up their alley. So for partners that I'm trying to sell something on, the conferences that they're going to for other reasons and networking, things like that are the best that for us anyways. 
Moderator (00:15:53 - 00:16:07)
 Yeah, sure have. What about learning and education? Do you see any other vendors, like, sponsoring that or being part of that in a way that you think is effective? 
Bridget Smith (00:16:11 - 00:16:46)
 I'm sure there is some. I. That's not where I generally tend to follow going to the cles and stuff. But I know that that has been helpful, at least with our conversations. When we decided to, like, leave filevine, it was at a CLE that Charlie met with some of their reps and stuff. So obviously that is effective and helps with communication and stuff and get people, you know, networked and whatever. But, yeah, I do think that that is helpful. 
Moderator (00:16:47 - 00:17:01)
 Yeah. Great. Let's talk now about implementation. So the company decides to go ahead with sepio. What has your experience Been like with implementation so far and has that matched what you expected? 
Bridget Smith (00:17:02 - 00:17:31)
 Yeah, for the most part it's completely matched what we expected it to be. We are having a little bit of difficulty connecting it to our case management system. But again we went live with Supio and our case management system all within the past couple of weeks and it's been a little chaotic. So I expected some twists and turns and kinks, so we're just working those out. Um, but everything has been, as expected, awesome. 
Moderator (00:17:33 - 00:17:54)
 So last few questions and these can be, can be a little more fun. One of them is if you were CEO or COO of Supio, what would you do to better serve a client like yourself? And it can be anything from the product to how you manage the people, the sales process, the any part of it. 
Bridget Smith (00:17:56 - 00:18:21)
 I think because they have such a superior product to everyone else, I don't think they would be hurting their business or costing much money if they did offer a more hands on approach to learning. I think that they would actually take a lot of business from other people if they did offer that. So that's something that I would probably push for. 
Moderator (00:18:21 - 00:18:40)
 Yeah. Fantastic. And what does success look like for you a year from now in using Sepio? Where have you gotten to? What is and. And what do you think could potentially block you from getting there a year from now? 
Bridget Smith (00:18:40 - 00:19:28)
 I would like for all of our injury cases to be pushed through Supio. I think at this point there's a little bit of hesitation on a couple of our guys that do the higher case value, some of the trucking stuff to use it because they like to send out demands very quickly. We in Ohio, you can leverage bad faith and so they push out demands pretty quickly. So they weren't thrilled with the turnaround time. But I know we can, you know, request expedited demands and things along that line that will help. But I would like to see success for us would be putting every single solitary case, injury case that we have into supl. 
Moderator (00:19:29 - 00:19:35)
 You said there's certain timelines that you wish were shorter. Is it for specific cases? Can you expand on that? 
Bridget Smith (00:19:38 - 00:20:06)
 Generally are the like higher value cases where you have like a commercial truck accident or something along those lines where you're probably going to get policy limits quickly, they will sign that case and get out of demand like almost immediately. So with the turnaround time of like five to seven business days to get your demand back, they would like to see that a little bit shorter. 
Moderator (00:20:06 - 00:20:14)
 I think what time frame would be acceptable and what time frame would be exciting? 
Bridget Smith (00:20:18 - 00:20:29)
 Exciting would probably be 48 hours. Acceptable, I would say, is like, maybe 72, three to four days, probably. Max. 
Moderator (00:20:29 - 00:20:44)
 Yeah. Great. And now that we've kind of reached the end of the questions, is there anything about Supio that you're surprised I didn't ask about or Eve or you think they would really value from learning about? 
Bridget Smith (00:20:48 - 00:21:08)
 No, I think their. Their sales guy, Sal, was amazing. He was really great. He's very. All of their team is very easily accessible, and one thing that I really liked about them is they continually follow up, so I'm not having to constantly reach out to them. So I think they have a really good team of people and communicators over there. 
Moderator (00:21:08 - 00:21:12)
 Awesome. Well, Bridget, it was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you so much for taking time today. 
Bridget Smith (00:21:12 - 00:21:13)
 Thanks, Drew. 
Moderator (00:21:14 - 00:21:15)
 Have a great day.

MacDonald Law Professional
Margie Smith (00:00:02 - 00:00:03)
 Great. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:03 - 00:00:09)
 And I have you here as the Office Manager of McDonald Law Professional. Is that true? 
Margie Smith (00:00:11 - 00:00:21)
 It is true. We're called McDonald's Injury Lawyers. We're also like David McDonald Professional Court. But, yeah, McDonald's Injury Lawyers is the name we're known by. 
Moderator (00:00:22 - 00:00:38)
 Got it. Great. Thank you for sharing that and correcting me. And can you tell me how your role was related to evaluating your involvement in evaluating sepio or any other tools like it? 
Margie Smith (00:00:40 - 00:01:02)
 Yeah, we. The lawyers had actually found it before, and I kind of came in once they had already had an initial conversation regarding it, but then once it came into that we were, like, moving towards making a commitment, then I was involved as far as looking at that and comparables and mostly pricing. 
Moderator (00:01:04 - 00:01:16)
 Yeah. Got it. Well, I'd love to talk about it. So as much as, you know, what originally prompted your firm to evaluate a solution like sepio. 
Margie Smith (00:01:18 - 00:01:29)
 We've been looking at different AI things. And I believe it was another firm that had used copio that told us about it, that were impressed with how things were going and told us about it. And so that's when we started looking into it. 
Moderator (00:01:31 - 00:01:47)
 Got it. And what were you. You were looking at AI tools. Were you just motivated by efficiency or, like, and that there's so, so much new tech, or was there a specific problem you're trying to solve or something else? 
Margie Smith (00:01:49 - 00:01:53)
 We're very tech savvy in general as a firm. 
Moderator (00:01:53 - 00:01:53)
 We. 
Margie Smith (00:01:54 - 00:02:24)
 David McDonald was one of the first lawyers to do the first iPad trial. Like, we're very. We try to keep on top of things like that. And so it's always something that we're interested in. In particularly, we were looking to improve our medical chronology. It was taking a lot of time to have our clerks do it, and we were hoping to find a tool specifically for that tool for that issue. And that's why Supio seemed like a great fit. 
Moderator (00:02:25 - 00:02:34)
 Great. And were you looking for. On the medical chronology side, what were the key criteria you were using as you talked to different providers? 
Margie Smith (00:02:38 - 00:03:01)
 Mostly that we wanted a couple different options. We wanted the chronology option, but then we also like the ability to ask questions and, like, be able to teach it. Not teach it, but, like, work with the system to ask specific questions and find out specific things. And so we really liked that. To have both of those aspects. 
Moderator (00:03:01 - 00:03:17)
 Yeah. And you mentioned it before. I think you mentioned that kind of some of the partners who were involved earlier and then they brought you in. Can you just help me clarify who was involved in the evaluation and their different roles and focus? 
Margie Smith (00:03:19 - 00:04:01)
 Yeah. So our firm is a little bit of an interesting setup. We have one main partner, managing partner, and then we have two associate lawyers, but the associate lawyers are the main partners. So normally I don't think associate lawyers would dive into big decisions like this as early on as happens in our firm. But with our firm, because it's a family business, a lot of decisions are run through both. So it was our main partner, David, and then his two sons, John and Chris, which kind of we look at as a bit of a management team with them and myself. So we were all kind of involved in it, but they had done the first conversation. 
Moderator (00:04:02 - 00:04:06)
 Yeah, got it. What other vendors did you evaluate? 
Margie Smith (00:04:08 - 00:04:30)
 We run our files through a program called filevine and they have an AI service as well. We've talked to them a couple times about it. And so we use that as a bit of a comparison because we already have all of our files stored in there. So it could have been a good option. 
Moderator (00:04:32 - 00:04:46)
 Say that. Yeah, they could have been a good option. What. Tell me more about what you think the kind of strengths and weaknesses of filevine were for the specifically like this AI medical chronology. 
Margie Smith (00:04:47 - 00:05:55)
 Yeah, the biggest difference that we felt was the people aspect, the human aspect that CPIO provided. We liked that there was kind of a last check of a human that wasn't us, because if we still have to double check all the work from AI, then it's not really doing much. It's not doing as much as we wanted it to. So we like that. Especially with like a medical chronology, medical records, doctors have the worst handwriting. If anything is handwritten, AI is not going to be able to read it. Also in Canada, I think sometimes we put dates in a different order and so sometimes the dates can be wrong and AI wouldn't know enough to kind of think about that. So we like that there is last check by a person. We felt more confident in that. And we really liked when we did the demo and we got to upload an entire file and really like dive into it and play with it. That I think. I think actually getting to use the program really well. Let us. With Soldas on it. 
Moderator (00:05:56 - 00:06:11)
 Yeah, let's talk about that, because that's a big statement. I heard you just say getting to try and use the product really sold you on it. Tell me what you were able to do and what trust it gave you, how it pushed you over the edge to say, hey, this is the right product for us. 
Margie Smith (00:06:13 - 00:07:15)
 Yeah, they let us upload an entire file and really just see what the program would do. And I think that was Really a selling feature because in theory people can sell you on all sorts of things in a meeting, one on one, some video meeting where you're watching the PowerPoint presentation but then actually being able to go in, use the product, see what it does, ask the questions that we would want answers to. Especially because in the legal world there are so many different facets, there's different types of law, we're Canadian and so you don't want things that are only American based. And so yeah, it was actually seeing a file in there and seeing how our prompts would make it work because you guys have different prompts than we do and you know we're not going to only use your prompts. So being able to work with it ourselves and go like okay, what questions would I ask it? How would I build a relationship with it? That definitely sold us on it. 
Moderator (00:07:16 - 00:07:47)
 Awesome. I have a set of survey question for you if you don't mind. I'll just read it to you. Just. We try to get a little quantitative data. So the first is kind of your grading of Supio on different categories. So it can be one to five where one is strongly disagree and five is strongly agree. And so the first one's on pricing. So from 1 to 5, Supio's pricing was competitive and aligned with the value offered. 
Margie Smith (00:07:50 - 00:07:52)
 I would say four. 
Moderator (00:07:53 - 00:08:01)
 Okay. Supio's overall approach and company values and culture were a good fit for our organization. 
Margie Smith (00:08:04 - 00:08:04)
 5. 
Moderator (00:08:05 - 00:08:11)
 Subio's product and surface offered the key features and capabilities we needed to meet our requirements. 
Margie Smith (00:08:13 - 00:08:13)
 5. 
Moderator (00:08:14 - 00:08:14)
 Super. 
Margie Smith (00:08:15 - 00:08:16)
 Can I switch that to a 4? 
Moderator (00:08:16 - 00:08:19)
 Of course you can. 4. 
Margie Smith (00:08:19 - 00:08:29)
 We've had a couple comments of things that we would like to improve the service already that we sent to our like customer service person. So yeah, I'll say four on that one. 
Moderator (00:08:29 - 00:08:40)
 I'm going to circle back to that. We're going to finish the last two and we'll circle back. Supio sales team effectively communicated the implementation process and their ability to deliver a smooth onboarding. 
Margie Smith (00:08:41 - 00:08:43)
 Yes. Five. Super easy. 
Moderator (00:08:43 - 00:08:50)
 So if you technology platform and infrastructure appeared robust and reliable and aligned with our technology requirements. 
Margie Smith (00:08:54 - 00:08:54)
 4. 
Moderator (00:08:55 - 00:09:00)
 Let's talk about the key features and capabilities. Sounds like you shared these already, but I'd love to hear about them. 
Margie Smith (00:09:02 - 00:09:36)
 Yeah, the one thing that we have suggested is that you would be able to make folders within a client file to kind of separate different types of documents. They have an option to pin documents when you want to search only certain ones. But it would be great if there were folders where we could say like these are this specific issue. These are, you know, our reports, these are the other size reports that are typical things. And so we mentioned that that would be helpful if there was a way to have a folder structure within one client file. 
Moderator (00:09:37 - 00:09:54)
 Got it. Tell me more about what would make the pricing score higher. Was it about the. Just the packaging of it or was it the actual number? Like what, what do you, what would you like to see changed? 
Margie Smith (00:09:55 - 00:12:10)
 The packaging was good. The number I definitely think could be lower, but I guess the human aspect is what you pay a little bit more for. I will say coming into it in the first year, it's really difficult to know how to like commit to a number. And I think that they could have a first year plan that's different because we, you know, we started at a certain number of packages for our package and we've already actually increased our number of credits. But even then it's tough to know, to know what you're going to need for an entire year when you just sign up to the package is really difficult. And so I think that they could have a bit of a different pricing structure where the first year, I think they should have enough confidence in their program that people are going to keep using them and want to buy more credits without having to force people to commit to something or not commit to something. Like when I was trying to renegotiate the plan with them, there was something where like if we ended up needing more credits, we'd have to pay a worse price, which seemed a little counterintuitive. Like, okay, but don't you want us to sign up for more things than you? That type of thing. And at the beginning you've got so many files to throw in there. But like even next year I'm already starting to think about, I don't know how many credits I would sign up for next year because we'll already have so many of our files in there. So it's a bit, it's a bit confusing with the way that the credits happen. I, it makes sense because it does spread out the cost throughout the year. So you're not, you know, when we signed up and we put 40 files in within the first month, that wasn't just a huge chunk of money out of our pocket. So like, I understand the theory and actually does work that way, but um, it just, it's almost, I wish there was a, the lower the price will go. Even counter, like even in the past to try to sell you on liking it. Yeah, totally making any sense. 
Moderator (00:12:10 - 00:12:10)
 Totally. 
Margie Smith (00:12:12 - 00:12:28)
 We threw 40 files in within the first month legitimately, and we only bought 50 credits. And so we automatically, after a month, we're like, okay, we're loving this. We need to figure out how many credits we might actually use. And I still don't know if we've done the right number. 
Moderator (00:12:30 - 00:12:45)
 Sure, you mentioned filevine before and some of Subio's strengths, but I'm curious, was there anything that filevine did that Subio could learn from things you think they did? Well. 
Margie Smith (00:12:48 - 00:13:39)
 It'S not. I don't think it's something that Supio could take from them. It's more. That file line is where we already store all of our emails and correspondence. And like, we have something called tasks, so it's kind of like a to do list for our staff. And so filevine, in theory, I thought their AI would be able to search through all of that as well. I don't think they're there yet, but I think they will get there and then they'll be very competitive. Because if I was able to use AI and say, make me a list of all the tasks that haven't been completed by my staff, you know, that would be very helpful from a management perspective. But I don't know, unless the Bureau is going to become a practice management tool as well, I don't know if you'd ever be able to compete with that. 
Moderator (00:13:41 - 00:13:42)
 Yeah, totally. 
Margie Smith (00:13:44 - 00:14:01)
 Unless there was a way to upload all the emails. You know, if there was a way to link all emails and put those into a folder and use AI to be able to search, you know, to dos or conversations or anything like that, that could be something like. Could do. 
Moderator (00:14:02 - 00:14:11)
 Sure. How about you? Reference? Kind of. The implementation was pretty smooth and easy. Can you tell me more about that? 
Margie Smith (00:14:14 - 00:14:37)
 Yeah, it's very easy to add members, it's very easy to upload files. As I said, we uploaded 40 in a row and we had some that were really urgent and their customer service was like, we were able to say, hey, this one's more urgent, this one's less so. Yeah, it was. It was really smooth and easy. We had no issues at all from that perspective. 
Moderator (00:14:37 - 00:14:45)
 Great. How about the sales experience? Is there anything that you think they did well or could improve on? 
Margie Smith (00:14:47 - 00:15:13)
 Yeah, I think that they explained this program very well and explained the system well. They've offered us lots of extra training and extra courses. We haven't taken them up on all of that yet because I think we're still in the stage where we just want to play around with it a little bit. But yeah, from the sales perspective, definitely giving Us the file to upload and play with was definitely a game changer. 
Moderator (00:15:14 - 00:15:58)
 Yeah. So I have a little another quick poll for you that is about the, about the sales experience, just to get some more quantitative data. If you don't mind, I'll just ask you. It's one is a poor experience and five is excellent. And so ask you, how was Suppio's understanding of your business needs and pain points? Great. How is their knowledge of Supio's product and capabilities? How effectively did they communicate Supio's value proposition? 
Margie Smith (00:16:01 - 00:16:03)
 Five great. 
Moderator (00:16:03 - 00:16:07)
 Was the quality of the product demos and presentations? 
Margie Smith (00:16:10 - 00:16:11)
 Five great. 
Moderator (00:16:11 - 00:16:15)
 And how responsive and timely was their team and follow up? 
Margie Smith (00:16:17 - 00:16:19)
 5 like better than 5 really great. 
Moderator (00:16:20 - 00:16:43)
 That's awesome. So thinking back on our conversation today, what do you think the most important things super could do to improve, you know, you shared some features that you'd like, but just overall the business, they're trying to better serve you and win more, more legal clients. Do you have any advice for them? 
Margie Smith (00:16:50 - 00:17:06)
 No, I think, I think they need to really hold on to the fact that they've got the human element. I think that's what makes them different from the ones that I've seen. But no, otherwise it's been great and very impressive. 
Moderator (00:17:07 - 00:17:24)
 Yeah, great. Let me see. Look at my questions, make sure I didn't miss anything. Were there any other vendors that you looked at besides filevine and Sepia? 
Margie Smith (00:17:25 - 00:17:44)
 Those are the ones that I was a part of. I don't know if the lawyers have looked at more of them. Sure, yeah, those were the ones that I was, I was a deeper part of. If they had done, maybe it would have only been preliminary for the earlier ones. 
Moderator (00:17:44 - 00:18:00)
 Yeah, I, I think you mentioned that how they had found Sepio, but if you don't mind sharing some more details. Was there like continuing legal education or events or was it just a referral from other people is what I think I remember hearing. 
Margie Smith (00:18:02 - 00:18:25)
 Yeah, I know it was just a referral from another law firm. One of the partners in another law firm was coming. We just opened up our new office in March, so was coming to visit the office and sitting down and chatting with David, our main partner, and he brought it up and I think maybe the word of mouth and they had spoken so highly of it as well, that was the. What got us. 
Moderator (00:18:26 - 00:18:36)
 Yeah, that makes sense. Well, great. Is there anything that you thought I was going to ask about regarding the superior that I have? Not yet. 
Margie Smith (00:18:38 - 00:18:45)
 Oh, good question. No, I don't think so. I think that is kind of what I was expected. 
Moderator (00:18:45 - 00:19:07)
 Yeah. Sounds good. And let's see what I guess we're always interested in. Are there any other great you said your technology forward and doing some interesting things. What other tools do you really love especially in the legal AI space if you've tried any other ones? 
Margie Smith (00:19:11 - 00:19:46)
 We use something called Lexus AI and kind of Lexus AI is kind of the AI from the legal side of things. You can ask questions more about the rules of law whereas me you superior to tell us about our case. Lexus AI tells us about the law and so those are kind of our two bread and butter right now that we're diving into. Yeah. So that would be that's that's kind of a different facet than what you guys do but we that's another AI thing we love. 
Moderator (00:19:47 - 00:19:53)
 Well this has been great. I really appreciate your time. Thank you so much for sharing your feedback. 
Margie Smith (00:19:54 - 00:19:55)
 No, no problem. Thank you. 
Moderator (00:19:55 - 00:19:56)
 Have a great day. 
Margie Smith (00:19:57 - 00:19:58)
 Thank you.

Julia Martinez (00:00:27 - 00:00:28)
 This is Meg. How can I help you? 
Drew Giovanoli (00:00:28 - 00:00:32)
 Hi, Meg. I have a call with Julia Martinez this morning. 
Julia Martinez (00:00:33 - 00:00:34)
 Hey, what's your name? 
Drew Giovanoli (00:00:34 - 00:00:36)
 My name is Drew Giovanoli. 
Julia Martinez (00:00:39 - 00:00:41)
 Okay, hold on one second. And where are you calling from? 
Drew Giovanoli (00:00:41 - 00:00:46)
 We're calling from Buried Winds. Okay, thank you. 
Julia Martinez (00:00:47 - 00:00:48)
 No problem. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:01:10 - 00:01:59)
 Hi, Julia. This is Drew Giovanoli. How are you? Good. Thank you so much for making time for the Supio interview today. I just want to run through a few things. First of all, thank you. Supio has hired my company to learn about their buyers so they can better serve their customers and, you know, improve the product. And so your feedback is super valuable. And so, with your permission, over the next 20 minutes or so, I'll ask you questions about your experience and just your general use of tools like this. Share whatever you feel comfortable with. And with your permission, we'll record this only for use of Forsupio internally. Is that okay with you? 
Julia Martinez (00:02:04 - 00:02:22)
 This is a little premature because I haven't quite gotten into using the program fully yet. We haven't had our training, so that's completely up to you if you want to continue on with the call or maybe perhaps do it at a later date. I'm not quite sure what you're planning on asking, but I thought I would just mention that right off the bat. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:02:22 - 00:02:56)
 No, I appreciate that. And it is still super relevant because the first interviews we do are all about kind of your buying experience and what you were looking for and what triggered it and how you found them, those types of things. So you're. You're in the right place, and we're. We're grateful to have you. Um, I would love to just confirm some quick details. So you're Julia, you're with Cursio Law, and you recently evaluated AI Tools for plaintiffs, and you did choose to go with Supio. Is that all correct? 
Julia Martinez (00:02:58 - 00:03:03)
 Well, this is the only program that I evaluated, but yes. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:03:04 - 00:03:11)
 Yeah, that's fine. And do you mind my starting Just introducing your role and tell me a little bit about the firm. 
Julia Martinez (00:03:13 - 00:03:16)
 You're already there. You're. You're breaking up. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:03:16 - 00:03:27)
 I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? Yes, I can hear you. Yeah, I was saying, if you don't mind, to start. Just introducing your role and tell me a little bit about Cursio Law. 
Julia Martinez (00:03:29 - 00:03:56)
 Sure. Yeah, I'm. I have worked with Tom since 2013, so I've been with the company for over 10 years now. And Curcio Law is a personal injury firm, so we handle, you know, the majority of our cases are, like, auto accident cases. We have, like, slip and falls, dog bites, premises liability, things of that nature. But the majority of our cases are motor vehicle accidents. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:03:57 - 00:04:02)
 Understood. And. And what's the. How big is the firm? How many lawyers? And then support staff. 
Julia Martinez (00:04:05 - 00:04:20)
 The attorneys and support staff. Let me see. Let me give you a guesstimate here. See, so I got roughly seven support staff. Roughly. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:04:20 - 00:04:30)
 Okay, great. And how did Sepio become introduced to your firm? 
Julia Martinez (00:04:33 - 00:05:08)
 Mr. Curcio was attending. Oh, goodness. What was it, an IV? I forgot what it was, but he attended some sort of seminar. I'm not quite sure. I'd have to look back through the emails as to how he. And tell you in just a minute. It was an ID meeting at the Broadmoor last year, apparently. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:05:09 - 00:05:13)
 And I'm sorry, I'm not super familiar, what does the ID stand for? 
Julia Martinez (00:05:15 - 00:05:16)
 N3 board. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:05:17 - 00:05:32)
 IB got an injury board. Awesome. And would you say that Mr. Curcio is heading to that meeting looking for a tool like this, or just discovered it and found it could be useful? 
Julia Martinez (00:05:34 - 00:05:57)
 Well, he's always looking to see what the next thing is. You know, we want to stay ahead of the game. So if there's AI tools that we can use to benefit the practice. And he's gonna, you know, check. Check into it and look into it, or have me look into it first rather than get my thoughts on it and then. And then proceed from there. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:05:58 - 00:06:16)
 Yeah. And I want you to correct me or tell me this is accurate. What I've heard so far is he met the company in some capacity at an IB conference or event, and then he came to you and asked you to evaluate it to see if it would be a good fit for the firm. Is that accurate? 
Julia Martinez (00:06:17 - 00:06:18)
 That is accurate. Yeah. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:06:18 - 00:06:28)
 Got it. And when you started to evaluate it, what criteria came to mind? Like, how did you grade whether this would be a good tool for you? 
Julia Martinez (00:06:30 - 00:07:25)
 Well, the whole purpose of us reaching out really, is we have a current case in house that this woman was very badly injured, and her initial hospital record alone is over 10,000 pages. And I am generally the one that does the demand for Tom. And we also have a retired nurse who does medical chronologies for us as well. But the thought of one of us taking on a 10,000 page for that purpose just doesn't seem like a good use of our time. You know what I mean? And if we could have a AI tool that. That can cut down on that, on our time, for that significantly, then. Then we figured, why not? 
Drew Giovanoli (00:07:25 - 00:07:47)
 Yeah. So time savings. And just for you personally Just like happiness. But beyond that, was there a bit of a. Is there any bit of it that's cost savings too? You know, kind of long term. It allows you to work on other things while the tool works on that. And so you guys can. Yeah. 
Julia Martinez (00:07:49 - 00:08:15)
 Absolutely. And, you know, I know that. That Mr. Curcio is excited about it because there's a lot of things that are just, you know, going to be at his fingertips with him just simply typing in something into the AI program, asking, you know, questions that. That will easily be able to sit through all this stuff and pull out things, you know, within a matter of minutes that would otherwise take an extreme amount of time. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:08:15 - 00:08:45)
 Sure. You mentioned it was motivated by a large case, 10,000 page, but how frequently do you think that you foresee using it? Do you think there's. Do you feel like many of your cases, it being a benefit to you, or is this kind of like, once in a while you get a big case and you'll use it for. 
Julia Martinez (00:08:47 - 00:09:38)
 You know, not just the big cases that we have in house, but like, other ones where there's a lot of prior medical records and, you know, things that we would have to sort through to find out, like prior diagnoses. Is it similar to the complaints that they're having now after the accident? You know, things like that. Like, we have another case that it would have been helpful on where this girl sustained, like, her fifth concussion after this accident happened. And so, like, sorting through all those prior meds, I feel like CPA would have been good for that. So I would say, roughly, we probably have a good handful of cases that this will benefit, you know, on a yearly basis, if not. If not more than a handful. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:09:39 - 00:09:46)
 Sure. And you mentioned you did not evaluate any other vendors, Is that correct? 
Julia Martinez (00:09:47 - 00:09:57)
 That's correct, yes. I was only asked to. To reach out to Supio for. For evaluation purposes by Mr. Curcio. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:09:57 - 00:10:21)
 So, yeah, great. I'd love to hear. What did you perceive as Supio's, you know, biggest strengths? And I. I know that it's going to take on work for you, but in evaluating its capacity to. Can you surecut anything that you gave you kind of positive sentiment, made you feel like Sepio is pretty strong at this? 
Julia Martinez (00:10:25 - 00:11:04)
 Just like the case that I mentioned before, like, I've been kind of playing around with it. I uploaded some records already for that particular case, and then I just typed in show me all op reports, and it's like populating all of the op reports that, you know, within a matter of minutes that would have taken me Quite some time to go through all of those records and pull those. Those reports out myself. So that's super helpful and you know, just like with the demands and stuff like that, that can be time consuming. So I feel like it's definitely a good. A good fit. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:11:04 - 00:11:21)
 Yeah, that's great. When you were evaluating it, what concerns did you have or skepticism or perceived weaknesses or anything that. Yeah. You thought wasn't a strength for cpo? 
Julia Martinez (00:11:25 - 00:11:54)
 None that I can think of. Because when I was talking with Levin, he's the one that did the initial evaluation with me. I have heard in the past about hallucinations, like AI hallucinations, and he said that that won't happen with a program because it only pulls info, you know, specifically from the documents that are uploaded. So that would have been my only concern. Really. I can't think of anything else. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:11:56 - 00:12:37)
 Yeah, that makes sense. I have a little poll, a little survey questions if you don't mind asking. We try to get just some quantitative data here in the, in the call, even though it's just you and me chatting and so if you don't mind, I'll just ask you some questions. And they're one to five, Right. Where five is you strongly agree with the statement and one is you strongly disagree with this statement. Do you mind if we do that? Okay, so the first statement is Sepio's pricing was aligned with the value offered. 
Julia Martinez (00:12:42 - 00:12:44)
 I forgot what the pricing was, honestly. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:12:44 - 00:12:58)
 Okay, no problem. No, that's okay. We could say don't know. If you. If you don't know. Company values and overall approach were a good fit for our organization. 
Julia Martinez (00:13:00 - 00:13:02)
 Yes, strongly agree. So that's five, right? 
Drew Giovanoli (00:13:02 - 00:13:03)
 Yep. 
Julia Martinez (00:13:04 - 00:13:04)
 Yep. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:13:06 - 00:13:22)
 Service offered the key features and capabilities we needed to meet our requirements. Subio sales team effectively communicated the implementation process and their ability to deliver a smooth onboarding experience. 
Julia Martinez (00:13:25 - 00:13:30)
 We haven't trained yet, so I don't know if that question encompasses that or not. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:13:30 - 00:13:45)
 That's fair. Yeah. We say don't know and then this is similar to an earlier one, but the. Like. The platform appeared robust and reliable and aligned with our technical requirements. 
Julia Martinez (00:13:48 - 00:13:51)
 So bar yester. So I give that a five at the moment. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:13:51 - 00:14:05)
 Yep. Okay, great. Well, thank you for doing that. I'm curious, were there any features that you wish that Sepio had that. That they perhaps didn't have? 
Julia Martinez (00:14:07 - 00:14:18)
 Not that I can think of. You know, perhaps once I get the training on the program and have used it for a while, then maybe I'd have a different answer to that, but for now I can't think of anything. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:14:18 - 00:14:26)
 Yeah. Did you in, in your kind of investigation, did you work alongside the sales team? Did you get to speak to them? 
Julia Martinez (00:14:29 - 00:14:44)
 Evan is part of the sales team, but I did. He's the one that I did the evaluation with and then he was on the call with Andreas, so I'm not sure if they're on the sales team or not. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:14:45 - 00:14:46)
 Yeah, got it. 
Julia Martinez (00:14:46 - 00:14:47)
 I'm assuming so. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:14:47 - 00:14:53)
 Yeah. How was that experience? What do you think the sales team did well or where could they improve? 
Julia Martinez (00:14:55 - 00:15:10)
 They did a great job. The only thing I would comment on is that in the. The subsequent call that we had with Andreas, his wi fi guess wasn't working properly. So that was a little difficult, but aside from that, it was good. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:15:11 - 00:15:59)
 Okay. And I'm going to ask you one more set of 1 to 5. You could also add that. Just say, I don't know, it's the last few questions here, but on the 1 to 5, it's for the sales team. How well do you think they understood your business needs and pain points? Five being an an excellent understanding or one being poor. How would you rate their knowledge of Sepio's products and capabilities? How were they. Were they effective communicators of your value proposition? How was the quality of product demonstrations and presentations? 
Julia Martinez (00:16:01 - 00:16:02)
 Not so far. 5. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:16:02 - 00:16:09)
 Okay. And then last one on the set is how responsive were they in their follow ups and timely in their follow ups? 
Julia Martinez (00:16:11 - 00:16:32)
 The follow ups have been good with the exception of, I guess for some reason my email went to spam folder. When I had emailed Andreas about something, though he didn't respond as quickly as. As I would have hoped. But you know that that's just technical difficulty, so. Yeah, I don't even know if that's worth mentioning. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:16:32 - 00:17:00)
 Sure. Well, no, it's good to know just in case. Is there anything that I didn't ask you about today that you maybe expected me to when you, when you thought about an interview about Supio? Okay. One of my favorite questions is if you were Supio, well, what would you do to better serve Julia and Cursio law? 
Julia Martinez (00:17:05 - 00:17:14)
 I don't know. You know, like I said, after I used the program for a while, maybe I'll have a better response. But at the moment I don't know. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:17:14 - 00:17:49)
 Yeah, no problem. And then you're about to use it and so you haven't gotten into the product yet, but from the demo, is there, is there anything you're hoping Supio can accomplish that you're not quite sure if it does or you know, just like a dream use case, like something else that would save you a ton of time. Just like the. The first demonstration did anything that, like, you don't know if it does, but you really wish it did. 
Julia Martinez (00:17:52 - 00:17:53)
 Not that I know of. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:17:53 - 00:17:54)
 Okay. 
Julia Martinez (00:17:54 - 00:17:55)
 Think of anything. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:17:55 - 00:18:03)
 No problem. Well, thank you for your time today. That was really useful. We'll follow up with compensation and hope you have a wonderful day. 
Julia Martinez (00:18:04 - 00:18:05)
 Okay, thank you. 
Drew Giovanoli (00:18:05 - 00:18:07)
 Thank you, Julia. Bye. 
Julia Martinez (00:18:08 - 00:18:09)
 Sure. Bye. Bye. ",,,7/23/2025 3:51pm

The Hurt Boss
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:05 - 00:00:10)
 Hey, Jeremy, this is Drew Giovanoli calling for our scheduled meeting about CPIO feedback. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:00:14 - 00:00:18)
 I'm supposed to call you or you're going to call me, but I don't have to do that anymore. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:00:18 - 00:01:11)
 No, we're all set. Thank you for making time today. The short, the short spiel is that I run a business that collects feedback for a living. And Supio's hired us because they're trying to improve their product and try to improve their services. And so for the next 20 minutes, 25 minutes, I'll ask you questions. You ask whatever you feel comfortable answering. It will be recorded with your permission, for exclusive use of Supio only internally. Is that okay with you? Awesome. Well, again, thank you for making time. They value it and I appreciate it and I. I quite enjoy. I get to do these interviews. So let me just start out with some context. Setting you are at Saturn Law Group. I assume that this is your. Your group, but if you don't mind just introducing yourself, your role and telling me a little bit about the firm. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:01:15 - 00:01:43)
 I own the firm. I've been doing like personal. I've been doing lawyering for like 28 years, something like that. Probably like exclusively personal injury law now for the past, what, 17 years. Mostly single event type of stuff. You know, slip and falls, accidents, wrongful death. But not in the mass torts or class action sphere or red mouth sphere. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:43 - 00:01:47)
 Got it. And is, do you have any support staff or additional attorneys on your team? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:01:49 - 00:01:49)
 Yes. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:01:50 - 00:01:53)
 Do you mind sharing kind of just the size so we get an idea of the scope of the firm. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:01:55 - 00:02:21)
 Sure. So we have a pretrial, like team that's got like, I don't know, three people, something like that. Four people. When you put the operations person in there. We've got a litigation team that's got a, like a litigation paralegal. That's really my paralegal. Another paralegal. There's a associate attorney, you know, still about three people besides me on the litigation side of things. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:02:22 - 00:02:32)
 Yeah. That's great. And so to get started, what prompted you to evaluate Supio? How did you meet them? What, you know, what was motivating about it? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:02:34 - 00:05:02)
 So I met Scipio at Mass Towards Main. Perfect. I met with. I met Carly Stone, I think is her last name. We chatted a little bit about product. I'll be honest with you. Mass towards Made Perfect was the first like, kind of exposure in Mass, pun intended, that I've had to the various AI platforms. Okay. And what I mean by that is we have a little bit of AI Component built into our case management process. Case management, like, you know, client management. Yeah, platforms. Okay. And so, you know, we could mess around with a little bit here and there on like mostly medical records and timelines and stuff like that. So like Mass Towards Made Perfect was the first time I'd seen multiple vendors and I was trying to figure out what, what was different between Stupio and for example, Even Up, I think was one that we had just met with before that. And I just thought Even up was another fancy demand package making outlet. So I was trying to figure out the difference between them. That's how I started talking with Carly. Okay. Like then a couple of weeks I guess went by and I went to a different seminar and there were other vendors there and I started talking a little bit more earnestly about what some of the platforms could do because it wasn't really clear with me from Mass Towards Made Perfect what the difference between people were like, you know, nobody was making it clear what Supio's difference was with Spin up, for example. And so I sat down for like 40 minutes with somebody, 30 minutes from, you know, somebody who, like another lawyer who was explaining how they were able to use some AI platforms. And I went back to my law firm and I talked to my paralegal and I said, this is out there as a product. Should we do some interviews of like vendors about this? And she said sure. So that's how we started like going back, setting up some edict to start looking at the various platforms, I guess with products, whatever you want to call it, companies. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:02 - 00:05:13)
 Yeah, that makes sense. And so did your paralegal then go do all the conversations or did you do it together? How did that just evaluation process work for your team? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:05:16 - 00:05:17)
 Partly do it. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:18 - 00:05:18)
 Yeah. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:05:22 - 00:05:34)
 Still have conversations with people outside of the conversations with me, you know, because she's younger than me, she's more interested, you know, she's more of a digital native as opposed to a digital immigrant, if you will. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:34 - 00:05:35)
 Right, yeah. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:05:35 - 00:05:50)
 And so, and so I, you know, also will defer to her and my associate attorney, he also was involved in the process. And the reason is because they're going to use this product more than I am. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:05:50 - 00:06:02)
 Sure. Well, as you started to talk to different vendors, did you come at it with a set of key criteria or did any key criteria evolve as you talk to them? And if so, what were those criteria? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:06:09 - 00:07:36)
 Criteria? Because like I said, I don't know that it's like this might be an industry wide problem. I don't know that the AI programs are doing a great job of educating lawyers, what they do. I think lawyers are educating lawyers about what you can do with AI. And it's more of a word of mouth or email type of thing, ironic or webinar type of stuff along those lines. And even from what I'm listening to or reading with these lawyers, given what I've just seen, you know, in a different presentation, we're nowhere close to what we can do with AI. Now, that being said, you know, when I started looking at these platforms, I was also of the opinion, like, fuck AI. I do this just as good as anybody else. You know, I didn't realize pluses and minuses, you know, I mean, honestly, I can do this lawyering thing better than a lot of people. So what do I need AI for? Now I'm beginning to see the super positives that we have with AI in terms of at least time saving. Right. So there's that. So getting back to your question, I don't know that we approached it with any specific criteria in mind because I didn't know that we had any specific goals in mind. Now as we started looking through some of the products, we started to kind of like narrow down into, you know, what we might be looking for, might not be looking for that type of thing. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:37 - 00:07:46)
 Yeah, sure, got it. Well, what vendors did you end up evaluating? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:07:48 - 00:07:49)
 Vendors. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:07:50 - 00:07:52)
 Yeah. You said you spoke to Couple. Yeah. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:07:56 - 00:08:29)
 We spoke with even up. We spoke with at least two other companies. One who I can't remember actually, both of them who I can't remember. Yeah, one I think I could remember, but I could get the name wrong. It might sound like an idiot, but I want to say like anytime AI or something like that, or I don't know, something, what have you. But then there was like, you know, a number of them, but those are the three I come up with off top, my head. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:30 - 00:08:37)
 Yeah, got it. And out the gate, what were the first impressions of. Of who was the strongest and why? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:08:46 - 00:08:50)
 The strongest contender. Contender out of the gate was Eve. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:08:51 - 00:08:56)
 Okay. And what, how come? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:09:01 - 00:10:47)
 So he said a couple of things that nobody else did. The very first thing that I'm going to tell you is before we even got on a sales call with them, they had asked us to provide us a case that we wanted to them to show us how it could utilize. We could utilize their software platform with our real case. Okay. So we took them up on their offer and we provided them one of the most complex cases that we have in our office. And then our presentation with them for 25 minutes was asking various questions about our case we probably already knew the answer to. And watching their AI answer these questions for us live, you know, in person, like, so does whatever live in person, studio audience, if you will. Right. And that was pretty impressive. Right? And then they let us, you know, play around with it for a week afterwards. Okay. While we were still evaluating it, and we could load up other cases and do other things. And that's when the associate on the file really started, like, opening up to, like, the platform. He was like, this thing's amazing. Got it right. He's a 30 something. So on the other hand, even up was like, very opaque, you know, very difficult to get answers from, you know, very difficult to figure out information on pricing. You know, we were referred. We got those refers back out to. Well, let me find out the answers to those questions and I'll get back to you. And, you know, that type of thing. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:10:49 - 00:12:58)
 And with Supio, to be honest with you, we just never really got anywhere besides, you know, the pumping and the puffery of how great their product was. Right. But it was like, you know, we just as a comparison, you know, when we were with Eve, it was, you know, two minutes of, you got any basic questions, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Can we dive in and can I show you what we can do with your case? And it went from there with Supio when Gregor got us on the phone, I'm pretty sure his name is Gregor, got us on the phone, you know, the first couple minutes, like, first, easily 10, 15 minutes where it was this back and forth discussion where, you know, he's trying to find out information about us and our firm. Right. And that's. I mean, I know that. I know that tactic, the sales tactic. I've been through enough. Those phone calls where, you know, I'm getting either, you know, softened up for information for the next phone call so that you all can take all that information and then get me a presentation of how it's going to go for these particular, you know, interest areas of my practice that you've identified through our conversation, or you're going to do it in the same conversation. But you're wasting my time, okay? Like, I'm a lawyer, I'm sitting here, I've got limited time to give you for a sales call. And. And you're asking me these questions so that you can then try to sell me on your product. If your product is good enough, you should be able to sell it to me anyway. That's the first thing that I'm beginning to think. The second thing is I'm beginning To realize as those questions are coming down, I'm not going to be able to spend a lot of time looking at and feeling this product out, because there's not going to be a lot of time left once these questions are done. And I'm right. Okay. I mean, and so we didn't really see much of Supio's product, if anything at all. And when you put that up against a presentation, like with Eve, where we're spending 25 minutes with Eve's product on our case, it's a vastly different experience. Presentation. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:13:00 - 00:13:06)
 Yeah. That's a fantastic walkthrough of that early sales experience. That's really great. Thank you. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:13:08 - 00:14:19)
 Sure. I mean, I'm just being straightforward, you know, I think. And I'm not so sure about this, but I'm pretty sure my paralegal said to Gregor afterwards, can we. Or during the conversation, can we test this? Can we play with this? And I think she was told, you know, well, you can put one of your closed files up or something along those lines and play with it along like that. Or something to that effect. I mean, it really wasn't as offered as robust, and it was really also fairly like. Like I said, opaque. We never really got to see Supio, but what we were told over and over and over and over and over again was that Scipio had the best AI, that they had invested the most money in the AI, that they had trained it the hardest, or how whatever you do with AI to make it like, you know, better than everybody else is. And, you know, that that was where they were beating. Everybody was on. On AI, on AI, on AI. And, you know, that's not a great way to sell people like me and. And lawyers, probably in general. And the reason is, is because we don't understand what the. That means that you trained your AI better than everybody else. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:19 - 00:14:19)
 Right. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:14:19 - 00:14:53)
 That doesn't mean anything to me. Right. What matters to me is how is your product going to make a difference to my practice either in time, efficiency, money, anything along those lines. Right. That's what matters to me. It's like, I keep telling people, I don't know how to build a watch, and I don't give a shit. It's actually. It used to be like, you know, don't tell me how to build me a watch. When I ask you what time it is right now. It's like, you know, I don't want to know how to build an iPhone, but I just want to be able to use it. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:14:54 - 00:15:11)
 Yeah, right. Did you get to. It sounds like Eve was the path and had a huge advantage. But did you even look at pricing or packaging from even up or Scipio or just for Eve? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:15:14 - 00:15:23)
 We. The pricing question in all the first calls, because if it's not going to work, there's no point in getting to the second call. You're wasting everybody's time. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:24 - 00:15:24)
 Sure. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:15:24 - 00:15:39)
 So, you know, I'll just be frank with you. Gu's pricing is competitive with everybody else's. Your. Your pricing is competitive with Even up. And Eve's pricing was a little bit better than both of y', all, but it's in the same ballpark. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:39 - 00:15:40)
 Got it. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:15:40 - 00:15:43)
 And they didn't lose out on price. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:15:45 - 00:15:56)
 Sure. And did the pricing. Was it structured this same way or were they structured in different ways and was anyway preferable for you. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:16:02 - 00:16:23)
 In their own ways? I don't recall the structures in particular. What I do recall is, you know, I find it like, annoying that the structure is there, you know, until like, surely if you hit like a certain volume, you find it less annoying. But you know that that also doesn't. You can't get away from the structured pricing, so it doesn't really matter. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:16:23 - 00:16:25)
 Well, would you like it to be priced like. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:16:27 - 00:17:06)
 Just think like, if you've got it. I mean, I'll be honest with you. If you've got a good enough product. Right. And it's. I mean, on. It's just a. It's all it is is, you know, it's like, you know, it's not like there's like, there's not any real incremental cost per case that I put into your system. Okay. Or at least I don't perceive one. And so it should just be a flat subscription rate per month. That's it. It should be a license fee, not a subscription, like per case or, you know, two subscriptions equal one case size or any of that other stuff. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:07 - 00:17:07)
 Sure. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:17:07 - 00:17:10)
 Right. That becomes real problematic. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:11 - 00:17:11)
 Right. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:17:12 - 00:17:34)
 So actually, now that I think about it, I think Eve did it pricing on a per case basis, not a per credit basis or this basis or something like that, which I think does like. I think they've got credits or subscriptions or something that you have to match up. And it doesn't make any sense intuitively. Like I said, it just needs to be a flat base. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:34 - 00:17:35)
 Yeah. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:17:35 - 00:17:40)
 And if your product is good enough, you should be able to stand behind the flat fee and not worry about it. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:17:42 - 00:17:42)
 Did. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:17:43 - 00:18:46)
 I mean, if your product is good. See, this is. And maybe I'm different in terms of pricing, but if my thought process is if your product is Good enough. I should be able to do a couple of things. I should be able to walk away with a month's notice because you should be able to provide me something so good. I don't want to leave now. I realize you guys need long term contracts in order to get financing and all that sort of stuff as you build the business up. So that might not be so desirable for your business model, but that to me is the statement that the business makes about what they feel is behind their products. Okay. And that's the point that I'm trying to convey. Right. If your product is so good that I'm not going to go anywhere else because you've got the best trained AI, then it should be at a set price. It shouldn't be in a way that I'm locked in buying a certain amount of credit that we do or don't have to use on a monthly basis. And if we don't move, use it up, we can slide them to this month or borrow from that month. None of it. It doesn't need to be that complicated. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:18:47 - 00:18:56)
 Did were all of the three vendors trying to get you to sign long term annual contracts or were any of them more usage based? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:18:57 - 00:19:04)
 No, everybody like wants long term contracts. There's very few in the space that want. That'll do it on a user space basis. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:05 - 00:19:05)
 Sure. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:19:08 - 00:19:17)
 Which is also kind of begs the question again, you know, if your, if your product is so good, what do you, what do you. Why, why are you so afraid that people are going to leave? 
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:18 - 00:19:19)
 Sure. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:19:20 - 00:19:28)
 Not to mention the like lazy status quo and lack of inertia these, the average human beings have. They ain't going anywhere. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:19:29 - 00:19:42)
 Yeah. I mean across all three, was there anything that you wish that they did to make your life easier that the companies just aren't there yet on? What would you like to see? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:19:45 - 00:20:12)
 You know, I think that, I think that there just needs to be one type of AI product to run an entire plaintiff's office. It's not that difficult. You know, there's AI products for intake and then there's becoming AI products for the medical stuff and AI products for the depositions and AI products for this. It's like, you know, you can't rob the same train too many times. This is the old expression goes. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:13 - 00:20:21)
 Yeah. What, what other tools are you using today? What, what other AI tools have you guys chosen to use? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:20:22 - 00:20:26)
 You're breaking up on me. Or being buffered. It sounds like you're in a tin can. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:26 - 00:20:31)
 Sorry about that. Just asking what other tools you use today? AI tools. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:20:34 - 00:20:36)
 Who do I use? For what? 
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:36 - 00:20:45)
 Do you use any other AI tools? Like do you use the Thomson Reuters AI tool or what's your case management software? 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:20:47 - 00:20:56)
 Really not. I can't understand you. I don't know if it's like, like I said, it's the buffering or the connection or there's something that. It sounds like it's reverberating, but I can't really understand you. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:20:57 - 00:21:12)
 Sorry. I don't know why I haven't moved, but that is frustrating. Let me try one more time. Sure. I'll try to call you back. Thanks. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:21:25 - 00:21:26)
 You there? 
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:26 - 00:21:33)
 Yeah. Is this better, Jeremy? Sure, yeah. Sorry, I, I haven't moved. I don't know what happened there, but that, that is frustrating. I'm sorry about that. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:21:36 - 00:21:44)
 When we were using recording software and stuff like that, call Rails, they start going through multiple switches and somewhere along the lines, you know. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:21:44 - 00:22:12)
 Sure. Well, don't have too many, too many more questions. But the, the last one was, is there anything that you wish the tools did that none of them did today that would make your life or your paralegals life easier? And you said you wish they were all together. And then I followed up with, well, what other tools are you using today? You mentioned a case management system. I imagine you're using some sort of like Thompson Reuters search tool. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:22:19 - 00:22:20)
 I think it's Lexus. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:20 - 00:22:20)
 Yeah. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:22:24 - 00:22:48)
 That's got an AI component to it. You know, I mean, the AI is now a component part of, you know, the office software suite, though we're not really using that as robustly as we probably should. The AI, you know, is. We've got it into file line for some components of the medical aspect of things. I mean, you know, it's everywhere, but it's not cohesively linked. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:22:49 - 00:23:08)
 Right, yeah, that's the problem. Yeah, understood. This has been a really helpful interview. I think the TSUPO is going to really value hearing about it, especially at the sales team. Get a lot of value. Is there anything that we. I haven't asked about that you kind of expected I would have based on your experience with these, these tools. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:23:11 - 00:23:27)
 Oh, but look, here's the deal. Like, this is not. Like this isn't rocket science, what everybody's doing. Right. And so I will tell you the most frustrating thing, the most frustrating experience is limited access to your product to see it. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:23:29 - 00:23:31)
 Sure, right. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:23:31 - 00:24:51)
 I mean, you know, and that can be done, honestly, you know, at the exhibit halls they can literally, they should be able to run people through. And I'm, I'm sure they are. You know, I Just didn't do it because I don't really set stuff up like that. I prefer to go back to the office and have the team evaluated and go through all of that stuff. But it's invaluable, the ability to rummage through and look and see how it works with an actual client file. Right. And all of the. When, when you're getting pushback on something like that, I wonder why. I mean, it goes back to that same question. If you've got such a good product, why would you not show it to me with my own client? Why wouldn't you show me how it's better than me, more efficient than my employees? Right. Because that's the ultimate challenge. Right. It's like, it's like I don't mind telling lawyers how to, how to do something on a case. I, I still can do it better than them. So what do I care if I give away the information? Right. Most of them are lazy anyway. They're going to come back to me, be like, hey, you do it right. You know what you're doing? You do it right. That's a, like, that's right. It's the same thing. If you're going to tell me that your AI is so good, then show it to me. 
Drew Giovannoli (00:24:51 - 00:24:52)
 Yeah. 
Jeremy E. Citron (00:24:54 - 00:25:22)
 And especially with a new product like this, this is not like a case management software that like lawyers have been dealing with for 25 years practice, and in some form or fashion, it just changes and updates, moves with the time, and nobody really thinks about this. This is a new product that people are scared of. Right. They're afraid it's going to take their job. They're afraid it's going to make them obsolete. Right.

 Yeah. Understood. Jeremy, this was a fantastic interview. You're thoughtful and I appreciate your responses and time today. We'll follow up with compensation over email in the next 24 hours. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's it. That's where I grew up. Yeah. I spent in Southern Connecticut, where I grew up. I'm in Austin, Texas now, though.

 Yeah. Well, great. You have a good end of your week.
