Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_1,"I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff.",Comprehensive Customer Experiences,Prompted to evaluate Rev and specific needs,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_2,"I think it's exactly the type of feedback they're looking for, so they're going to be excited about this type of conversation. In this interview in particular, you mentioned consent as an example and a bunch of Consent to search for instance card. I was wondering if you at a high level could identify a couple of different use cases, like how you use today and specifics and what those types of triggers or keywords or things you'd be looking for? I think they'd love to hear that feedback.",Comparative Analysis,Use cases and specific triggers for Rev AI,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_1_3,"Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. So it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. So sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area so we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners like me or very, very small firms. And so that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. So they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers so much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.",Workflow Optimization,Analyzing discovery and improving efficiency,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_2_1,"I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. So I really like that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. So if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, so to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not like we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And so I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidenced, if that makes sense.",Case Severity and Evidence Volume,Understanding the difference in handling serious cases versus less serious cases based on evidence volume and severity,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_2_2,"I think that equally, I mean, I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. Right. So they probably get more bang for their buck that way.",Case Prioritization and AI Utilization,Considering the value of AI in handling high-volume cases like DUIs and domestic violence,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_2_3,"I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. So voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, like something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just so I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, so sometimes it's not like you have a microphone. Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good. And I think that it would take the old school lawyers that are used to just sending it to a person would convince them to jump over.",Improvements in Voice Recognition and Transcript Clarity,Suggestions for enhancing voice recognition accuracy and transcript clarity for legal use,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_3_1,"I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. So let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I don't know how big of a margin that would really improve my day to day. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of like a cheat sheet for what you feed it. So if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. So if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. So these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. So if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then so I can find with each witness where they are so I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful. Yeah, And then do the same thing with those concepts. So any mention of guns, R and d ones like an overall take of all the files, rather it just be file by file.",Product Features,Feedback on potential improvements for Rev,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_3_2,"I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. Yeah, that is a little frustrating, but I'm not using it right now as gospel. Right. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it. I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. I could use it in a hearing. So that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more.",Product Features,Frustrations while using Rev,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_3_3,"I think so. Interesting question because there's definitely benefits of both not having to deal, especially since I don't have a paralegal or administration. Administration at all. I would say that the downside is that it's more paperwork. So I say I pass it along and then immediate thought was, have I actually though because am I keeping good enough track of all of my costs? Or is it if a transcript is five bucks, let's say it is more expensive for me to go and track it all than it is, just let that go. So that's one thing to consider. So that part of it is annoying. Also, if it's a subscription, you can write it off on your taxes and you don't have to continually, it's just done. So I think it should be an option.",Pricing,Billing preferences for Rev services,closed_won,Unknown,Leila Vaez-Iravani,2024-01-01
Unknown_Leila Vaez-Iravani_4_2,"Yes. I think some kind of indicator where maybe they do it in, I don't know, however, five minute chunks and then analyze the accuracy and then say these are your problem areas, like a red flag, like flag the areas. Yeah, that's a great idea, but I feel like they can improve the technology. I know it's out there, so it's just applying the technology to it. I think that makes so much more sense. That's just a bandaid to the ultimate issue, and they're going to lose people if they don't focus on that. If another platform comes out that is far more accurate. I mean, if I were them and I would be making these decisions, I would really put all my eggs in that basket, or not all of 'em, but I would focus very much on that, but I'm not in business.",Technology Improvement,Improving accuracy and technology,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
