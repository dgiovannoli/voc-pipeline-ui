Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_3_1,"A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? So look around, do you mind? Things like that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. So certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, so punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms.",Legal Research,Integration with Legal Research Platforms,closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,Insights on integrating with legal research platforms for improved case analysis,,,,Enhanced access to legal databases,Improved case analysis,,,Integration potential with legal research platforms,Complex case analysis,Enhanced case analysis metrics,Exploring integration with legal research platforms
Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_3_2,"Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. So it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. So sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area so we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners like me or very, very small firms. And so that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. So they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers so much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.",Legal Discovery,Efficient Legal Discovery Process,closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,Insights on improving legal discovery processes for efficiency,,,,Time-saving legal discovery tools,Efficient legal case preparation,,,Enhanced legal discovery efficiency,Complex legal discovery challenges,Improved legal case preparation metrics,Implementing efficient legal discovery tools
Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_5_1,"When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case. However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence.",Pain Points,How do you approach less serious cases with weak evidence?,closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,Approaching less serious cases with weak evidence from a mitigation and circumstantial standpoint,,,,,,,,,,,

Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_5_3,"However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. Right.

Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_6_1,"No, I'm lazy. No, I just was like, this worked for me in the past. They did a good enough job. I did notice last time there's quite a few errors I think that I didn't do the human, I think there's one that you can get humans to look it over. I think they just need to crisp it up a little bit. Voice recognition technology or whatever they use. There was a quite a bit of error. Also the distinction between speakers. Sometimes there was two speakers. I thought there was three. So again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. So voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, like something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just so I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, so sometimes it's not like you have a microphone.",Product Features,What improvements would you suggest for the product?,closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,"Product improvement suggestions related to voice recognition accuracy, speaker distinction, and error reduction",,,,,,"Voice recognition accuracy, speaker distinction, error reduction",,,"Accuracy issues, speaker distinction challenges, error margin",,"Enhancing voice recognition technology, improving speaker distinction, error reduction"

Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_7_1,"I don't. Cleo try to get me pretty hard. My caseload isn't big enough really now for me to do that. And I like a hands on approach. I've Dropbox for all my files, but I also actually have paper files still. It's helpful for me to visualize and see, and I like taking them into court so I don't have the laptop out and I'm a little bit more hands-on like that. Again, I'm a solo practitioner. If I started to take on staff, then I think that it would be inevitable. I'd have to jump over to something like that.

Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_7_2,"I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. So let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that.",Implementation,"What would make your life easier, your job easier?",closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,Suggestion for Rev to assist in client intake process by providing summarized voicemail content with key details for easy search and retrieval,,,,,,,,,,,Enhancing client intake process with summarized voicemail content
Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_9_1,"I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. Yeah, that is a little frustrating, but I'm not using it right now as gospel. Right. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it. I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. I could use it in a hearing. So that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more.",Accuracy,Frustrations with accuracy,closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,"Issues with accuracy are frustrating, improvement needed for reliability",,,,,,,,,Accuracy concerns,,
Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_9_2,"Yes. I think some kind of indicator where maybe they do it in, I don't know, however, five minute chunks and then analyze the accuracy and then say these are your problem areas, like a red flag, like flag the areas. Yeah, that's a great idea, but I feel like they can improve the technology. I know it's out there, so it's just applying the technology to it. I think that makes so much more sense. That's just a bandaid to the ultimate issue, and they're going to lose people if they don't focus on that. If another platform comes out that is far more accurate. I mean, if I were them and I would be making these decisions, I would really put all my eggs in that basket, or not all of 'em, but I would focus very much on that, but I'm not in business.",Accuracy Improvement,Suggested improvements for accuracy,closed won,Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani,Leila Vaez-Iravani,07/01/2025,Technology improvement needed for accuracy and reliability,,,,,,,,,Accuracy enhancement suggestions,,
