- Added universal timestamp parsing for multiple formats
- Enhanced clean_verbatim_response to extract timestamps before cleaning
- Updated LLM prompt to include start_timestamp and end_timestamp fields
- Modified CSV output to include timestamp columns for video integration
- Added test interface for timestamp extraction validation
- Supports formats: [HH:MM:SS], Speaker (MM:SS):, (HH:MM:SS - HH:MM:SS), etc.

Ready for production deployment with video integration capabilities."
