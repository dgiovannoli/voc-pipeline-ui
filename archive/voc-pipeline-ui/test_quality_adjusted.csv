"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_1_1","Insight into Customer Success Factors","Speaker 2 I run a research company and Rev is my client and they hired us to figure out how to improve their business and their products by interviewing people who've tried it out. if it's with your permission, we will chat for 25 minutes. I'll ask you questions and no bias, anything positive, anything negative is on the table, but do you want your permission to record it privately only for their use?","Customer Success","Understanding customer feedback and improvement strategies","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Insight into customer feedback collection and analysis for product improvement","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Insight into customer feedback collection and analysis for product improvement","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_1","Enhanced AI Feature for Legal Transcription","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","AI Feature Enhancement for Legal Transcription","Feedback on AI feature usage and potential improvements","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Positive feedback on AI feature usefulness and suggestions for enhancement","Improved efficiency in legal transcription, better understanding of interview content","AI feature positively impacts workflow efficiency and content comprehension","N/A","N/A","Enhanced customer experience through AI feature benefits","Positive feedback on Rev's AI feature and suggestions for further integration","High satisfaction with Rev's AI feature functionality and usability","AI feature usefulness and potential enhancements influence customer satisfaction and loyalty","Previous transcription service limitations led to the search for a more efficient solution","Increased efficiency in legal transcription, improved content comprehension, positive word-of-mouth referrals","Desire for AI feature integration of legal terms and enhanced customization options"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_2","Use Cases and Triggers for Legal Transcription","I was wondering if you at a high level could identify a couple of different use cases, how you use today and specifics and what those types of triggers or keywords or things you'd be looking for? I think they'd love to hear that feedback.","Use Cases and Triggers for Legal Transcription","Identification of specific use cases and triggers for transcription needs","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Insight into customer's specific use cases and triggers for transcription requirements","Understanding of customer needs and preferences for transcription services","Insight into customer's workflow and content requirements for transcription","N/A","N/A","Tailored transcription solutions based on customer's identified use cases and triggers","Customer input on specific triggers and keywords for transcription needs","Customized transcription services based on customer's identified use cases","Customer's use cases and triggers influence product development and service customization","Identification of specific needs and requirements for transcription services","Customer satisfaction through tailored transcription solutions, improved service relevance","Integration of customer's identified triggers and keywords for enhanced transcription services"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_1","Enhancing Legal Discovery Process with AI Integration","Yeah, I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind? Things that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing. Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.","Legal Discovery Process Enhancement","How could AI integration improve the legal discovery process?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","AI integration for legal discovery process optimization","Efficient discovery analysis, time-saving benefits","Potential integration with legal research platforms","Unknown technical aspects of AI implementation","Enhanced efficiency and accuracy in legal discovery","Improved workflow for legal professionals","Positive reception to AI-driven discovery tools","Potential for increased productivity and effectiveness","AI capabilities, integration feasibility, cost-benefit analysis","Challenges in manual discovery analysis, time constraints","Time saved in discovery process, accuracy of search results","Exploring AI solutions for legal research and discovery"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_2","Differentiating Legal Case Prioritization Based on Evidence Volume","Really good question. I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidence, if that makes sense.","Legal Case Prioritization","How do you differentiate between serious and less serious cases in terms of evidence volume?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Case prioritization based on evidence volume and case complexity","Efficient allocation of legal resources, optimized case handling","Experience-based case assessment and prioritization strategies","Balancing resource allocation for different case types","Strategic case management for optimal client outcomes","Tailored legal services based on case complexity and evidence volume","Positive impact on client representation and case resolution","Enhanced client satisfaction through focused legal strategies","Evidence assessment, case complexity, client expectations","Resource constraints, time management in legal practice","Client satisfaction ratings, case resolution efficiency","Continued refinement of case prioritization methods"

"N/A","Rev could improve accuracy and technology for better transcription quality","I think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, sometimes it's not you have a microphone. Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good. And I think that it would take the old school lawyers that are used to just sending it to a person would convince them to jump over.","Product Improvement","Areas for improvement in Rev's transcription service","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Accuracy and technology improvements needed for transcription quality","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Rev's potential to focus on high-volume cases for AI research and development","However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle.

"N/A","Rev could pivot towards client intake automation by providing summarized voicemail transcripts with key information for lawyers.","I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that.","Product Features","Feedback on potential improvements for Rev's services","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Rev could enhance client intake processes by providing summarized voicemail transcripts with key information for lawyers.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Rev could improve AI functionality by providing an overall analysis of multiple files, identifying speakers, and locations within transcripts for easier reference.","And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful.","AI Functionality","Feedback on potential improvements for Rev's services","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Rev could enhance AI functionality by providing an overall analysis of multiple files, identifying speakers, and locations within transcripts for easier reference.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Potential for AI-driven comprehensive analysis","Yeah, that's really great. Is this at all what you've seen other tools doing? Does a Clio have part of this space? I've never been on ccle other than a few years ago when they were trying to sell me their stuff, but I have no idea. The state of ccle now. Yeah, I mean it is a broad thing. I know they track finances to calendaring to different stuff, I'm not sure. I think it's more of a business platform than it is actually doing the substantive legal help. But I could be wrong. They could have pivoted. Sure. I'm going to launch a little survey in your screen just to rank how you value different criteria in the system. It seems you're enjoying Rev as it is, but if you had to rank what's important to you? Oh, rank. Okay. Cost accuracy, data security and compliance. Ease of use.

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_9_1","Accuracy is the top priority for users, even above speed and specific features.","I think specific accuracy has to be number two specific features.

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_9_2","Users value transparency and options in billing for transcription services.","I think . Interesting question because there's definitely benefits of both not having to deal, especially since I don't have a paralegal or administration. Administration at all. I would say that the downside is that it's more paperwork. I say I pass it along and then immediate thought was, have I actually though because am I keeping good enough track of all of my costs? Or is it if a transcript is five bucks, let's say it is more expensive for me to go and track it all than it is, just let that go. that's one thing to consider. that part of it is annoying. Also, if it's a subscription, you can write it off on your taxes and you don't have to continually, it's just done. I think it should be an option.","Pricing","How do users perceive the billing structure for transcription services?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Users value transparency and options in billing for transcription services.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_10_1","Improving accuracy and reliability of transcription technology","I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. I'm not using it right now as gospel. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it comfortably enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct. The biggest hangup is the need for more accuracy and reliability.
