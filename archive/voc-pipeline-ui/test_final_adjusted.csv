"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_1","Enhanced AI Features for Legal Use Cases","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","AI Integration for Legal Use Cases","How has Rev's AI feature enhanced your legal work and what additional features would you like to see for legal use cases?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Rev's AI feature has significantly improved the efficiency of legal transcription and analysis for complex cases, providing detailed insights and facilitating evidence presentation.","Improved accuracy and time-saving benefits for legal professionals, enabling quick access to specific interview segments and enhancing overall case preparation.","Positive experience with Rev's AI integration, highlighting the need for further customization options and legal-specific features for enhanced functionality.","Minimal risks identified, with potential areas for improvement focusing on tailored AI training for legal terminology and case-specific requirements.","Rev's AI capabilities offer a competitive edge in the legal transcription market, with potential for expanded features catering to legal professionals' unique needs.","Enhanced customer success through tailored AI solutions, driving positive feedback and referrals within the legal community.","Positive feedback on Rev's AI functionality, with suggestions for integrating legal terms and enhancing customization options for legal use cases.","High service quality demonstrated through efficient AI transcription and analysis tools, meeting the demands of legal professionals for accurate and timely results.","Key decision factors include AI accuracy, customization options, and legal-specific features, influencing the adoption and satisfaction of Rev's services.","Addressing pain points related to traditional transcription methods, Rev's AI solution offers a streamlined approach to legal case analysis and evidence preparation.","Success metrics include improved transcription accuracy, time savings in case preparation, and enhanced evidence presentation capabilities, showcasing the value of Rev's AI features for legal professionals.","Future plans involve further collaboration with Rev to enhance AI capabilities for legal use cases, focusing on tailored training and feature development to meet specific industry requirements."
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2_2","Efficient Discovery Analysis with AI Tools","Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.","Discovery Analysis Efficiency with AI Tools","How could AI tools improve the analysis of discovery documents and streamline the search process for legal professionals?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","AI tools can revolutionize the discovery analysis process for legal professionals, offering efficient search capabilities and streamlined document review.","Significant time savings and enhanced accuracy in discovery document analysis, enabling quick identification of relevant information and improving case preparation.","Positive reception to AI tools for discovery analysis, highlighting the need for intuitive search functions and comprehensive document scanning features.","Potential risks include data privacy concerns and algorithm accuracy in analyzing sensitive legal documents, necessitating robust security measures and validation processes.","AI-driven discovery analysis tools provide a competitive edge in the legal research market, offering advanced search functionalities and tailored solutions for legal professionals.","Enhanced customer success through efficient discovery analysis tools, driving productivity and effectiveness in legal case preparation and evidence gathering.","Positive feedback on the potential of AI tools for discovery analysis, with a focus on improving search efficiency and document scanning capabilities for legal professionals.","High service quality demonstrated through AI-driven discovery analysis tools, meeting the demands of legal professionals for streamlined document review and information retrieval.","Key decision factors include AI accuracy in document analysis, search functionality, and data security measures, influencing the adoption and satisfaction of AI tools for discovery analysis.","Addressing pain points related to manual discovery document review, AI tools offer a more efficient and accurate solution for legal professionals, reducing time and effort in information retrieval.","Success metrics include reduced time spent on discovery document analysis, improved search accuracy, and enhanced document scanning capabilities, showcasing the value of AI tools for legal professionals in streamlining case preparation.","Future plans involve further collaboration with AI tool providers to enhance discovery analysis features, focusing on user-friendly interfaces and advanced search algorithms to optimize legal research and case preparation."
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_1","Differentiating between serious and less serious cases based on evidence volume and stakes","I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidence, if that makes sense.","Decision Making","What indicates serious cases that make Rev worth using?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Distinguishing between evidence volume and stakes in serious and less serious cases","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Evidence volume and stakes determine the level of scrutiny in legal cases","Balancing time and effort based on case seriousness and evidence quality","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3_2","Utilizing Rev for deeper analysis in serious cases and mitigation strategies in less serious cases","When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case. However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence.","Decision Making","Where can Rev have the most value in legal cases?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Utilizing Rev for in-depth analysis in serious cases and mitigation strategies in less serious cases","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Leveraging Rev for evidence analysis and mitigation strategies based on case seriousness","Balancing evidence scrutiny and mitigation efforts in legal representation","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Rev could improve accuracy and technology for better transcription quality, especially in legal contexts with multiple speakers and body-worn camera recordings.","I think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, sometimes it's not you have a microphone. Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good.","Product Feedback","What improvements could Rev make to enhance transcription accuracy and usability, especially in legal contexts?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Improvements in transcription accuracy and technology for better quality, especially in legal contexts with multiple speakers and body-worn camera recordings.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"N/A","AI-driven Client Intake Enhancement","I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I don't dunno how big of a margin that would really improve my day to day. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful. Yeah, And then do the same thing with those concepts. any mention of guns, R and d ones an overall take of all the files, rather it just be file by file.","AI-driven Client Intake Enhancement","How could Rev improve client intake processes using AI?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Importance of Speed and Accuracy in Legal Tools","Yeah. Okay. Speed I think is the most important because when you want something, if you need it, you need it. I don't know. That's fluid though, because often usually I don't, but when you do, you do. I will put that. I think specific accuracy has to be number two specific features. Honestly, I would put three because that would be helpful, but if it's not accurate, then who cares? Actually, what to that, I'm going to put accuracy first. Cause data security, ease of use. I mean, I find the costs pretty reasonable.","Importance of Speed and Accuracy in Legal Tools","What criteria do you prioritize when evaluating legal tools?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","Accuracy and speed are crucial for legal professionals using transcription services","I think speed is the most important because when you want something, if you need it, you need it. I think specific accuracy has to be number two. Specific features, honestly, I would put three because that would be helpful, but if it's not accurate, then who cares? I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it. I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. that would be the biggest hangup.","Product Features","Ranking of important criteria in the system","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"N/A","AI transcription services should provide accuracy indicators and focus on improving technology","Yes. I think some kind of indicator where maybe they do it in, I don't know, however, five minute chunks and then analyze the accuracy and then say these are your problem areas, a red flag, flag the areas. I feel they can improve the technology. I know it's out there, it's just applying the technology to it. I think that makes much more sense. That's just a bandaid to the ultimate issue, and they're going to lose people if they don't focus on that. If another platform comes out that is far more accurate. I mean, if I were them and I would be making these decisions, I would really put all my eggs in that basket, or not all of 'em, but I would focus very much on that.","Process Improvement","Improvements in AI transcription technology","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
