"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_1","Yeah, that's fine.","Product Features","What insights did the interviewee share?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_2","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. (03:07): And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star.","Product Features","What features of Rev do you find most helpful in your work as a lawyer?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","Rev's ability to jump to specific spots in the transcript and easily access the corresponding recording is extremely helpful for lawyers looking for specific information in their interviews.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_3","(04:08): Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. So it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. So it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. So if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line. Speaker 2 (04:42): I think it's exactly the type of feedback they're looking for, so they're going to be excited about this type of conversation. In this interview in particular, you mentioned consent as an example and a bunch of Speaker 1 (04:55): Consent to search for instance card. Speaker 2 (04:58): I was wondering if you at a high level could identify a couple of different use cases, like how you use today and specifics and what those types of triggers or keywords or things you'd be looking for? I think they'd love to hear that feedback.

"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_4","Yeah, so I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? So look around, do you mind? Things like that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. So certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, so punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms.","Integration","How can the product be integrated with other research platforms used by lawyers?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","The interviewee suggests that the product should be integrated with other research platforms used by lawyers.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_5","I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers so much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.","Product Features","Is there a scenario in which you have, you've uploaded some audio content, it would be useful for you to add other content and then search, have revs AI search amongst the aggregate of all that content?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","Rev's AI could save lawyers time by analyzing and finding specific information within uploaded files.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Rev's AI could be a valuable tool for lawyers to analyze and find specific information within uploaded files.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_6","I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. So I really like that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. So if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, so to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not like we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And so I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidenced, if that makes sense.","Decision Making","What factors determine whether a case is considered serious or not?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","The seriousness of a case is determined by the volume of evidence, not necessarily the severity of the charges.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The volume of evidence is the primary factor in determining the seriousness of a case.","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_7","To an extent? To an extent it's one of those, yes, to an extent. To an extent. When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case. However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence. Speaker 2 (12:13): Totally. That makes sense. And the question purely comes from a, where can Rev have the most value? Where can it help the most?","Decision Making","Where can Rev have the most value?

"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_8","I think that equally, I mean, I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle. Right. So they probably get more bang for their buck that way. Speaker 2 (12:57): You said you came back to Rev. Did you evaluate any other options before you started using Rev? Speaker 1 (13:02): No, I'm lazy. No, I just was like, this worked for me in the past. They did a good enough job. I did notice last time there's quite a few errors I think that I didn't do the human, I think there's one that you can get humans to look it over. I think they just need to crisp it up a little bit. Voice recognition technology or whatever they use. There was a quite a bit of error. Also the distinction between speakers. Sometimes there was two speakers. I thought there was three. So again, it wasn't something that I could use in court. It was just helpful to me. I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. So voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, like something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just so I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, so sometimes it's not like you have a microphone. Speaker 3 (14:13): So Speaker 1","Product Features","What improvements could be made to the product's voice recognition technology?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","The interviewee believes that the product's voice recognition technology could be improved, particularly in cases where there are multiple speakers or background noise.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The interviewee suggests implementing better technology for voice recognition in cases with multiple speakers or background noise, as well as providing cues for when the technology is unable to accurately transcribe.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_9","I don't. Cleo try to get me pretty hard. My caseload isn't big enough really now for me to do that. And I like a hands on approach. I've Dropbox for all my files, but I also actually have paper files still. It's helpful for me to visualize and see, and I like taking them into court so I don't have the laptop out and I'm a little bit more hands-on like that. Again, I'm a solo practitioner. If I started to take on staff, then I think that it would be inevitable. I'd have to jump over to something like that. I know Cleo is well used or widely used and generally liked by my colleagues.","Integration","Do you use any other tools like a case management tool or any other software for your practice?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_10","Yeah, great. Speaker 1 (16:12): I think that's what it's called. Yeah. Speaker 2 (16:14): Yes. CLIO. I've seen that. Yeah. You mentioned functionality around maybe adding files that people could search through and expanded really great feedback on having certain keywords or terms that you're always looking for to better serve for those things. Anything else that you think would make your life easier, your job easier? It can be specifically AI related or not Speaker 4 (16:53): Specifically. Speaker 1 (17:01): I mean, another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. So let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. Speaker 3 (17:48): Sure. Speaker 1 (17:51): I don't dunno how big of a margin that would really improve my day to day. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things.","Process","What other features would make your life easier or job easier?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","Rev could pivot to help with client intake by providing a way to easily search for names, counties, and other important information from voicemails.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_11","And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of like a cheat sheet for what you feed it. So if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. So if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. So these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. So if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then so I can find with each witness where they are so I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful.","Process","How can the AI tool be improved to make the analysis process more efficient?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","The interviewee suggests that the AI tool should have a feature that provides an overall breakdown of the entire envelope, including all speakers and their locations in each transcript.

"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_12","To you? Oh, rank. Okay. Cost accuracy, data security and compliance. Ease of use. Specific features. Well, specific features is really vague. Speaker 2 (20:20): You could just throw at the bottom if you want, but that could be specific features could be if someone had the ability to find consent every time in any DUI. Speaker 1 (20:31): Yeah. Okay. Speed I think is the most important because when you want something, if you need it, you need it. I don't know. That's so fluid though, because often usually I don't, but when you do, you do. So I will put that. I think specific accuracy has to be number two specific features. Honestly, I would put three because that would be so helpful, but if it's not accurate, then who cares? Actually, you know what to that, I'm going to put accuracy first. Speaker 4 (21:02): Okay. Speaker 1 (21:05): Cause data security, ease of use. I mean, I find the costs pretty reasonable. Speaker 3 (21:23): Great. Speaker 1 (21:23): And with lawyers, we just pass the costs along to our clients. So I mean, we don't want it to be exorbitant, but we are not paying for it out of pocket. Speaker 2 (21:34): And so does the billing make sense? I've had other legal clients who actually charge per case, right? Or not per kind of a subscription. Would you prefer it to be billed in a different way that's more easily passed on?

"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_13","I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. Yeah, that is a little frustrating, but I'm not using it right now as gospel. Right. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it. I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. I could use it in a hearing. So that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more.","Product Features","Do you have any frustrations while using Rev?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","The interviewee is frustrated with the accuracy of Rev's transcription services.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The interviewee suggests that Rev should improve their accuracy in order to be a more reliable tool for legal proceedings.","N/A","N/A","The interviewee's main frustration with Rev is its lack of accuracy.","N/A","N/A"
"LawOfficesofLeilaVaezIravani_14","I think some kind of indicator where maybe they do it in, I don't know, however, five minute chunks and then analyze the accuracy and then say these are your problem areas, like a red flag, like flag the areas. Yeah, that's a great idea, but I feel like they can improve the technology. I know it's out there, so it's just applying the technology to it. I think that makes so much more sense. That's just a bandaid to the ultimate issue, and they're going to lose people if they don't focus on that. If another platform comes out that is far more accurate. I mean, if I were them and I would be making these decisions, I would really put all my eggs in that basket, or not all of 'em, but I would focus very much on that, but I'm not in business.","Product Features","What improvements can be made to the technology?","closed won","Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani","Leila Vaez-Iravani","07/01/2025","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The interviewee suggests implementing an indicator system to identify problem areas and improve the technology.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
