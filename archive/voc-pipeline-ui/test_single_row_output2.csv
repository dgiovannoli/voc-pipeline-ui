I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and so it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. So I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and so you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. So that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff.

(03:07):

And so it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing so I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. So that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, so consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star.

Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_4,"Speaker 1 (05:13):

Yeah, so I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? So look around, do you mind? Things like that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. So certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, so punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms.

You made a comment at near to the beginning that said you didn't use it for a while and then you took on some more serious cases.

Speaker 3 (08:44):

Yeah.

Speaker 2 (08:44):

Was serious related to just the depth of evidence, if that's the right word, but just the amount of materials for you to go through, or what indicates serious that makes maybe rev worth using on these cases but not the others?

Speaker 1 (08:58):

Really good question. I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. So I really like that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. So if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, so to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not like we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And so I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidenced, if that makes sense.

Speaker 2 (10:17):

It does. So is serious.

Speaker 1 (10:18):

It's a combination. So serious would be, when I say serious case, sorry.

Sorry. Is serious the penalty? Is that how you're grading

Speaker 1 (10:26):

It? Yeah, that's usually what I, yeah, penalty. I mean the typical way is felony misdemeanor, but it depends what it is. A felony theft charge, you could argue it's less serious than a misdemeanor domestic violence charge on your record. Right? So generally, yes. I look at the time, the exposure, if it's a felony, if it's a misdemeanor. Also the nature of the crime, is it just a drug offense? Is it a property offense or is it an offense where there's a tangible victim, violent offenses, anything sexual in nature, which I usually don't touch, those are inherently more serious.

Speaker 2 (11:06):

Yep. And is it accurate interpretation that because it's more serious, it's worth spending more time with the materials and going deeper?

Speaker 1 (11:16):

To an extent? To an extent it's one of those, yes, to an extent. To an extent. When I get a less serious case and I see there's a lot of, the evidence is really bad, I'm going to be fighting it not from an evidence standpoint. I'm going to be looking at the mitigation. I'm going to be getting them into treatment programs. I'm going to have them fight it from a circumstantial basis of, Hey, this is what the person's going through. Maybe his dad just died, or maybe he's an alcoholic that never got treatment. Now he's getting treatment, he's in therapy or DV cases. Hey, this is a couple that've been married for 20 years, no issues. Their daughter died. It's a hard time. They got in a fight and now they're in couples counseling, they're working it out. It's fine. It's a total aberration from, that's how I would fight that kind of a case. However, if the stakes are super, super high, I better be damn sure there's nothing I can argue on the basis of the evidence.

I think that equally, I mean, I think this is the thing, sure, those more serious cases, maybe the volumes higher and the stakes are higher. However, the amount of cases you get for DUIs and domestic violence are through the roof, and there could be a lower hanging fruit to grab, because those cases have the same things come up over and over that they could easily work on research and get some kind of AI together to tackle.

So

Speaker 1 (14:14):

Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good. And I think that it would take the old school lawyers that are used to just sending it to a person would convince them to jump over

Speaker 2 (14:32):

In the areas. You noticed that it was not accurate. Do you think that's related to, was it a specific names or certain types of things they were talking about, or was it you think a body cam related to distance? The quality of the audio got lower, and so

Speaker 1 (14:47):

It was, yeah, audio quality and also people talking over each other, which happens a lot.

Speaker 2 (14:59):

Let's stick on the topic of things that Rev could improve in addition to that, anything about the usage itself or the product or the interactions you've had with the company? Any feedback that you have for them?

Speaker 1 (15:11):

I'm trying to think. No, I mean, nothing stands out. It was pretty straightforward.

Speaker 2 (15:19):

Yeah. Do you use any other tools like a case management tool or any other software for your practice?

Speaker 1 (15:27):

I don't. Cleo try to get me pretty hard. My caseload isn't big enough really now for me to do that. And I like a hands on approach. I've Dropbox for all my files, but I also actually have paper files still. It's helpful for me to visualize and see, and I like taking them into court so I don't have the laptop out and I'm a little bit more hands-on like that. Again, I'm a solo practitioner. If I started to take on staff, then I think that it would be inevitable. I'd have to jump over to something like that. I know Cleo is well used or widely used and generally liked by my colleagues.

Speaker 2 (16:10):

Yeah, great.

To you? Oh, rank. Okay. Cost accuracy, data security and compliance. Ease of use. Specific features. Well, specific features is really vague.

Speaker 2 (20:20):

You could just throw at the bottom if you want, but that could be specific features could be if someone had the ability to find consent every time in any DUI.

Speaker 1 (20:31):

Yeah. Okay. Speed I think is the most important because when you want something, if you need it, you need it. I don't know. That's so fluid though, because often usually I don't, but when you do, you do. So I will put that. I think specific accuracy has to be number two specific features. Honestly, I would put three because that would be so helpful, but if it's not accurate, then who cares? Actually, you know what to that, I'm going to put accuracy first.

Speaker 4 (21:02):

Okay.

Speaker 1 (21:05):

Cause data security, ease of use. I mean, I find the costs pretty reasonable.

Speaker 3 (21:23):

Great.

Speaker 1 (21:23):

And with lawyers, we just pass the costs along to our clients. So I mean, we don't want it to be exorbitant, but we are not paying for it out of pocket.

Speaker 2 (21:34):

And so does the billing make sense? I've had other legal clients who actually charge per case, right? Or not per kind of a subscription. Would you prefer it to be billed in a different way that's more easily passed on?

Law Offices of Leila Vaez-Iravani_response_13,"Speaker 1 (21:55):

I think so. Interesting question because there's definitely benefits of both not having to deal, especially since I don't have a paralegal or administration. Administration at all. I would say that the downside is that it's more paperwork. So I say I pass it along and then immediate thought was, have I actually though because am I keeping good enough track of all of my costs? Or is it if a transcript is five bucks, let's say it is more expensive for me to go and track it all than it is, just let that go. So that's one thing to consider. So that part of it is annoying. Also, if it's a subscription, you can write it off on your taxes and you don't have to continually, it's just done. So I think it should be an option.

Speaker 2 (23:01):

Sure.

Speaker 1 (23:02):

Why not just do both. Yeah.

Speaker 2 (23:03):

Yeah. We may have covered some of this, but do you have any frustrations while using Rev?

Speaker 1 (23:12):

I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. Yeah, that is a little frustrating, but I'm not using it right now as gospel. Right. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it. I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. I could use it in a hearing. So that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more.

Speaker 2 (23:56):

The spectrum is human transcription that be the most accurate, and then AI on the other side, which is very accurate, but there's that gap there.
