"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_1","N/A","I run a research company and Rev is my client and they hired us to figure out how to improve their business and their products by interviewing people who've tried it out. if it's with your permission, we will chat for 25 minutes. I'll ask you questions and no bias, anything positive, anything negative is on the table, but do you want your permission to record it privately only for their use?","Product Features","What insights did the interviewee share?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_2","The interviewee, a lawyer, highlighted the significant benefits of using Rev's AI feature for transcribing and analyzing legal interviews. The ability to quickly navigate to specific points in the transcript, extract key information, and gain a preliminary understanding of the content before detailed review has greatly enhanced their workflow efficiency. They also expressed a desire for Rev to integrate legal terms, allow customization of AI learning for specific legal needs, and provide a feature for highlighting important sections to improve accuracy and relevance.","I was using a transcription company when I first started out nine years ago. I forget what they're called, but it was all just humans doing it and it took a little bit of time to get the stuff back a few days and it was significantly more expensive. I looked for another option when I needed something on the spot and I found Rev and I loved it because you could click on the time and it would take me straight to that interview because with law there's specific things I'm looking for and you need the transcript, but the transcript alone isn't enough to introduce into evidence. You actually have to have the real recording. that was really helpful, being able to just jump to the spots. And I didn't use it for a really long time. I just didn't need it. And then recently I've had some more serious cases where I've had to go through lots of interviews and such, and I love the new AI feature because sometimes I have a few hours worth of stuff. And it's good to just see the bullet points to know, okay, what am I even looking at? Because sometimes they'll have a scene where there's 10 different officers and I just get the body-worn camera, but I have no idea what each video is showing I can easily see, okay, they're interviewing this witness and okay, these are the things they're talking about. Sometimes they'll even have the officer's name if he says it or she. that's been really, really helpful and I think it would be great. I have told other lawyers about Rev, if there was a way to integrate legal terms or if I were to maybe educate the AI feature saying, Hey, these are the things I'm looking for, consent, did they ever give consent to a search? Or a way to ask it questions and then maybe even learn from what the things are important if there's a feature to Star. Okay. Yeah, that was helpful. That was helpful. it can kind of get better and smarter. That would be great. it's not just the transcription now, I'm really loving it for the ai. It kind of does a little bit of that. We a little bit, I mean I still need to go through, but it gives me an idea of when certain conversations are happening in the transcript. if I have an hour long transcript, two hour long transcript, at least rudimentary in the rudimentary level, I can go in and get a gist of what I'm looking at before having to go line by line.","Product Features","How do you use Rev today and what specific triggers or keywords do you look for?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Rev's AI feature significantly enhances workflow efficiency for legal professionals by providing quick navigation, key information extraction, and preliminary content understanding.

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_3","The key insight from this response is the need for a tool that can efficiently analyze and search through large volumes of evidence in legal cases, particularly for serious cases where the stakes are higher. The interviewee highlights the challenges faced by lawyers in sifting through extensive discovery materials and the potential benefits of a tool that can quickly identify relevant information, saving time and improving case outcomes.","Yeah, I'll give you an example. A lot of times someone is pulled over let's say for a DUI and then the officer asks, Hey, if they kind of get an idea or maybe run the record, and this is someone that has a long record, they might say, Hey, do you mind if we take a look around the car? look around, do you mind? Things that would give a clue that there's a situation where consent to search is happening. But there's lots of different scenarios that I could think that's just one, right? Oftentimes I get a lot of domestic violence cases too. certain questions, whatever keywords around different types of unwanted touching, punch, grab, shove, all those kinds of things, that would be great because that's where I know when those questions are being answered. But I think there would probably be, it may even be something that they would want to talk to these places, Westlaw or LexiNexis or any of these kind of research platforms that lawyers use and see if there is a way to maybe integrate or if there is a way to say, Hey, look, I'm defense, criminal defense, and then even more specific, this is A DUI case and then have pull from a database that would search those terms. I don't know, whatever. I don't know how AI works. I'm not very technical, but that would be a really, really, really advantageous thing. Another thing that comes up a lot, which I think would be a bit of a pivot is analyzing. it wouldn't necessarily be transcription, but analyzing discovery. sometimes just today there was a thread on my private defenders. I'm in a network for different private defenders around this area we can talk because we don't have an office, there's not a public defender's office. Most of them are solo practitioners me or very, very small firms. And that's kind of the network where we talk, Hey, does anyone have a case on this? Does anyone know this judge? And there was a person that had thousands of pages of discovery and they were looking for a specific interview and it was buried and the DA wasn't giving them any clues. they were saying, Hey, is there anything that we can compel the DA to have to tell us? Is there a discovery rule or any way to get around this? I can't find it. These old timer attorneys are talking about control F on all the PDFs. That's just not efficient. There's such, and I immediately thought, I don't know if there's a tool out there for that, but that would save lawyers much time. If I could just add a PDF, add a PDF, or add a file, whatever, and then they could go through and it could analyze all of that and then find certain things that I'm looking for. I mean, that would be really helpful.","Legal Case Evidence Analysis Tool","How do you currently handle large volumes of evidence in legal cases, and what challenges do you face in this process?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","The need for a tool that can efficiently analyze and search through large volumes of evidence in legal cases, particularly for serious cases where the stakes are higher.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Challenges faced in analyzing extensive discovery materials in legal cases, particularly in serious cases where the volume of evidence is high.","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_4","The level of seriousness in legal cases determines the depth of evidence analysis and time spent, with more serious cases requiring a thorough examination of evidence for potential legal strategies.","I think that it was actually the fact that the serious cases tend to have more evidence, but that's not always the case. I really that question because it's actually more of the case that it's the volume of the evidence. I would say that with a caveat because a lot of these less serious cases, there may be a ton of evidence, but if I find the evidence which shows that it's a DFL, excuse my French, a dead fucking loser is what we say privately, meaning there's no way we would be able to fight this. It's a matter of getting a good negotiated plea, then I'm not going to really dig for as many. The stakes for A DUI are lower. if it's a DFL, I'm not going to spend hours and hours and hours, even if there's a large amount of discovery, picking it apart piece by piece, it's simply not worth it. And my clients didn't hire me for that level of legal work, to speak, right? I'm going to do the best job, but it's not we're looking at 16 years in prison. We're looking at a slap on the wrist. And I'll do my job, my due diligence for sure, and do the best outcome, but I'm not going to be picking it over as much as if I had a serious case with the same level of evidence, if that makes sense.","Legal Case Analysis","What factors determine the level of seriousness in legal cases and how does it impact the analysis of evidence?","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Different levels of seriousness in legal cases impact the depth of evidence analysis and time allocation for legal strategies.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_5","Rev could improve accuracy and technology for better transcription quality, especially in cases with multiple speakers or muffled audio. Enhancements like clearer speaker distinctions, improved voice recognition, and better cues for transcript understanding would be beneficial.","I think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is. Just I have an idea of, okay, what's going on here? Because there's quite a few times where it got hard, especially with legal, with body-worn cameras, sometimes it's not you have a microphone. Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good.","Product Feedback","feedback on Rev's transcription service accuracy and technology","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","accuracy and technology improvements needed for transcription service","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"
"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_6","Rev could improve by enhancing voice recognition technology for better accuracy, especially between multiple speakers, and providing better cues for transcript understanding. Additionally, they could pivot towards client intake by offering summarized voicemail snippets with key search functionalities and AI analysis for discovery purposes.","I do think there's quite a big margin that could be closed that they could improve upon. voice recognition between two different people, maybe some kind of better technology around when it's muffled and things of that nature. Or maybe even better cues, something where you can show the transcript alone and the transcript of the cues where it says unable to, whatever the hangup is.

Anything they can do to improve that, which I'm sure it's there somewhere, I think would be really good. And I think that it would take the old school lawyers that are used to just sending it to a person would convince them to jump over. Another way that Rev could maybe pivot is for client intake. let's say a client calls, I don't answer for some reason and it goes to voicemail. I mean, I don't know how useful that would be such a snippet, but I'm just trying to think outside the box of what possibly, yeah, maybe something that you could send a voicemail to Rev and then it could kind of give you the cliff notes, search for names, search for county, search for these things that I would want on a client intake and see if they, I dunno, maybe could easily give you that. I really think the biggest thing there is a way to feed it discovery, feed it, just the evidence and not just the audio files, but other things. And then may, what would be really good is have them kind of keep note of all the people and places. Kind of a cheat sheet for what you feed it. if I give it 10 files overall, maybe an overall analysis, not just within the transcript. if I put in, let's say there's an envelope, oftentimes when you file things, you have an envelope and within that envelope there's separate files. Okay. Have it give you an overall AI breakdown of the whole envelope. these are all the speakers we identified. Alright. And these are where you can find them in each transcript. if I have one witness, if I have Officer John, I know Officer John is in file, A, E, F, and O, right? And then I can find with each witness where they are I don't have to do any of that analysis myself and go pick through. That would be enormously helpful.","Product Features and Client Intake","Areas for improvement in Rev's services and potential pivots for client intake","closed won","Buried Wins","Leila Vaez-Iravani","01/15/2024","Rev could enhance voice recognition technology, provide better cues for transcript understanding, and pivot towards client intake services with summarized voicemail snippets and AI analysis for discovery purposes.","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"

"BuriedWins_LeilaVaezIravani_9","The most important criteria for the speaker are speed, accuracy, and specific features in a transcription service. Accuracy is prioritized over specific features, and the speaker values speed the most. They find accuracy issues frustrating but currently use the service as an indicator rather than relying on it completely. They suggest that the service should offer indicators for less accurate sections and potentially provide human transcription for problematic areas.","I think specific accuracy has to be number two specific features. Honestly, I would put three because that would be helpful, but if it's not accurate, then who cares? Actually, what to that, I'm going to put accuracy first... I think that the issues with accuracy are a little frustrating at times. Yeah, that is a little frustrating, but I'm not using it right now as gospel. Right. I'm using it as a good indicator of what's going on. It would be fantastic if it got to the stage where I could use it. I was comfortable enough to know that it is absolutely 100% correct or 99, I don't need to go through line by line in a pinch. I could use it in a hearing. that would be the biggest hangup. They got to crisp it up more, quite a bit more... Yes. I think some kind of indicator where maybe they do it in, I don't know, however, five minute chunks and then analyze the accuracy and then say these are your problem areas, a red flag, flag the areas. Yeah, that's a great idea, but I feel they can improve the technology. I know it's out there, it's just applying the technology to it. I think that makes much more sense. That's just a bandaid to the ultimate issue, and they're going to lose people if they don't focus on that. If another platform comes out that is far more accurate.
