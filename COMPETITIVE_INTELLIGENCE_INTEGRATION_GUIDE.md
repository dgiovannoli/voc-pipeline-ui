## üìã **COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT INTEGRATION**

### **üéØ Example Integration: "Rev vs. Key Competitors in Legal Transcription"**

Based on the competitive intelligence report structure, here's how to integrate it:

#### **1. Market Landscape Integration**
```python
# Extract from external report and integrate with VOC insights
market_analysis = {
    "market_size": "Legal transcription market estimated at $2.5B globally",
    "growth_rate": "12% CAGR expected through 2028", 
    "key_drivers": ["AI adoption", "Legal tech modernization", "Cost pressure"],
    "voc_validation": {
        "customer_demand_alignment": "High - VOC shows strong demand for AI capabilities",
        "pricing_sensitivity": "Medium - VOC indicates value over price focus",
        "feature_preferences": "Strong alignment with market trends"
    }
}
```

#### **2. Competitive Positioning Matrix**
```python
competitive_landscape = {
    "Rev": {
        "market_share": "15%",
        "customer_satisfaction": "93%",
        "price_positioning": "Premium",
        "key_strengths": ["Superior customer experience", "Advanced AI technology"],
        "key_weaknesses": ["Limited market awareness", "Higher pricing"]
    },
    "Competitor A": {

        "customer_satisfaction": "78%",
        "price_positioning": "Premium",
        "key_strengths": ["Strong market presence", "Comprehensive features"],
        "key_weaknesses": ["Complex onboarding", "Poor support"]
    }
}
```

#### **3. Strategic Recommendations Integration**
```python
strategic_recommendations = [
    {
        "category": "Market Positioning",
        "recommendation": "Establish thought leadership in AI-powered legal transcription",
        "rationale": "VOC shows strong customer satisfaction + external research shows opportunity",
        "priority": "High",
        "timeline": "3-6 months",
        "success_metrics": ["Brand awareness", "Market share growth"]
