# 🔧 Research Question Coverage Fixes Summary

## **📊 Issues Identified & Resolved**

### **1. Pricing Tab - No Data Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Pricing Analysis tab was empty despite having pricing-related themes
- **Root Cause**: Filter was too restrictive, only checking theme statements, not quotes
- **Solution**: Enhanced pricing filter to check both theme statements AND individual quotes

### **2. Research Question Coverage Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Questions 8, 9, and evaluation criteria questions showed as "uncovered"
- **Root Cause**: Simple keyword matching wasn't recognizing specific question patterns
- **Solution**: Enhanced question-theme alignment logic with specialized handlers

## **🔧 Technical Fixes Applied**

### **Enhanced Pricing Filter (`excel_win_loss_exporter.py`)**
```python
def _filter_themes_by_pricing_focus(self, themes: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Added comprehensive pricing keywords
    pricing_keywords = [
        'price', 'cost', 'expensive', 'cheap', 'affordable', 'value', 'roi', 'budget',
        'competitive', 'premium', 'discount', 'pricing', 'billing', 'payment',
        'worth', 'investment', 'return', 'savings', 'expense', 'cost-effective',
        'money', 'dollar', 'paid', 'pay', 'charge', 'fee', 'rate', 'costly',
        'economical', 'financial', 'monetary', 'economic', 'fiscal'
    ]
    
    # Now checks BOTH theme statements AND individual quotes
    for theme in themes:
        # Check theme statement
        has_pricing_keywords = any(keyword in theme_statement for keyword in pricing_keywords)
        
        # Check individual quotes
        quotes = theme.get('all_quotes', [])
        has_pricing_quotes = False
        for quote in quotes:
            quote_text = quote.get('verbatim_response', '').lower()
            if any(keyword in quote_text for keyword in pricing_keywords):
                has_pricing_quotes = True
                break
        
        # Include if ANY criteria match
        if has_pricing_keywords or is_pricing_subject or has_pricing_quotes:
            pricing_themes.append(theme)
```

### **Enhanced Question-Theme Alignment (`excel_win_loss_exporter.py`)**
```python
def _check_question_theme_alignment(self, question: str, theme_text: str, theme_type: str) -> List[str]:
    # Handle evaluation criteria questions
    if 'criteria' in question and 'evaluate' in question:
        evaluation_keywords = ['criteria', 'evaluate', 'assessment', 'decision', 'factor', 
                             'consideration', 'requirement', 'need', 'important', 'key']
        if any(keyword in theme_text for keyword in evaluation_keywords):
            matches.append('evaluation_criteria')
        if any(word in theme_text for word in ['price', 'cost', 'quality', 'service', 'support', 
                                              'feature', 'capability', 'integration', 'ease', 'user']):
            matches.append('evaluation_factor')
    
    # Handle pricing rating questions
    elif 'pricing' in question and 'rating' in question:
        pricing_keywords = ['price', 'cost', 'expensive', 'cheap', 'affordable', 'value', 
                          'rating', 'score', 'rate', 'pricing', 'billing', 'payment', 
                          'money', 'dollar', 'paid', 'pay', 'charge', 'fee']
        if any(keyword in theme_text for keyword in pricing_keywords):
            matches.append('pricing_rating')
        if theme_type in ['strength', 'weakness'] and any(word in theme_text for word in ['price', 'cost', 'value']):
            matches.append('pricing_evaluation')
    
    # Handle provider evaluation questions
    elif 'provider' in question and 'evaluate' in question:
        provider_keywords = ['provider', 'vendor', 'supplier', 'company', 'solution', 
                           'service', 'product', 'evaluate', 'compare', 'choose', 'select']
        if any(keyword in theme_text for keyword in provider_keywords):
            matches.append('provider_evaluation')
```

### **Enhanced Keyword Extraction (`excel_win_loss_exporter.py`)**
```python
def _extract_question_keywords(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
    # Special handling for evaluation criteria questions
    if 'criteria' in text.lower() and 'evaluate' in text.lower():
        evaluation_terms = ['criteria', 'evaluate', 'assessment', 'decision', 'factor', 
                           'consideration', 'requirement', 'need', 'important', 'key', 
                           'provider', 'vendor', 'supplier']
        # Extract and include evaluation terms
    
    # Special handling for pricing rating questions
    elif 'pricing' in text.lower() and 'rating' in text.lower():
        pricing_terms = ['pricing', 'rating', 'score', 'rate', 'price', 'cost', 'value', 
                        'expensive', 'cheap', 'affordable', 'money', 'dollar', 'paid', 
                        'pay', 'charge', 'fee']
        # Extract and include pricing terms
```
