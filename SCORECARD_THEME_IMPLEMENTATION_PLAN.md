# Scorecard-Driven Theme Development Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of **Scorecard-Driven Theme Development via Criteria-Aligned Sentiment** as a **complementary approach** to the existing similarity-based theme generation. This creates a dual-lens system for richer insights.

## Strategic Context

### Current State
- **Stage 4**: Similarity-based theme generation using quote similarity and semantic grouping
- **Focus**: Finding patterns through quote similarity across interviews
- **Output**: Themes based on recurring patterns and semantic relationships

### New Complementary Approach
- **Stage 4B**: Scorecard-driven theme development using criteria prioritization
- **Focus**: Anchoring themes to buyer's prioritized scorecard criteria
- **Output**: Themes based on performance on prioritized decision criteria

### Enhanced Synthesis
- **Stage 4C**: Enhanced theme synthesis combining both approaches
- **Focus**: Convergence detection and hybrid insights
- **Output**: Comprehensive executive insights from dual-lens analysis

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements

#### New Tables
```sql
-- Scorecard themes table
CREATE TABLE scorecard_themes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    theme_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    scorecard_criterion VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sentiment_direction VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    client_performance_summary TEXT NOT NULL,
    supporting_quotes JSONB NOT NULL,
    -- Quality metrics and metadata
);

-- Criteria prioritization table
CREATE TABLE criteria_prioritization (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    criterion VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    priority_rank INTEGER,
    priority_score DECIMAL(4,2),
    -- Quote analysis and sentiment distribution
);

-- Enhanced theme synthesis table
CREATE TABLE enhanced_theme_synthesis (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    synthesis_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    synthesis_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    scorecard_theme_ids INTEGER[],
    similarity_theme_ids INTEGER[],
    -- Executive insights and quality metrics
);
```

#### Enhanced Existing Tables
```sql
-- Add complementary columns to existing themes table
ALTER TABLE themes 
ADD COLUMN scorecard_theme_id INTEGER REFERENCES scorecard_themes(id),
ADD COLUMN synthesis_theme_id INTEGER REFERENCES enhanced_theme_synthesis(id),
ADD COLUMN complementary_evidence JSONB;

-- Add scorecard context to stage3_findings
ALTER TABLE stage3_findings 
ADD COLUMN scorecard_criterion_priority INTEGER,
ADD COLUMN sentiment_alignment_score DECIMAL(3,2);
```

### 2. Core Components

#### A. Stage 4B: Scorecard-Driven Theme Analyzer (`stage4b_scorecard_analyzer.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate themes based on criteria prioritization and sentiment alignment

**Key Functions**:
1. **Criteria Prioritization Analysis**
   - Identify which criteria were prioritized in buyer decisions
   - Calculate priority scores based on relevance and company coverage
   - Determine the 5-6 criteria that matter most

2. **Sentiment-Aligned Theme Generation**
   - Group high-relevance quotes by sentiment direction
   - Generate themes when multiple quotes speak to the same prioritized criterion
   - Ensure sentiment consistency and quote diversity

3. **Quality Scoring**
   - Evidence strength (relevance scores)
   - Sentiment consistency (alignment across quotes)
   - Quote diversity (company representation)
   - Stakeholder weight (decision-maker perspectives)

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "theme_title": "Support is Friendly but Not Proactive",
  "scorecard_criterion": "support_service_quality",
  "sentiment_direction": "negative",
  "client_performance_summary": "Support team is responsive but lacks proactive guidance",
  "supporting_quotes": [...],
  "strategic_note": "Proactive support could differentiate from competitors",
  "overall_quality_score": 0.75
}
```

#### B. Enhanced Theme Synthesizer (`enhanced_theme_synthesizer.py`)

**Purpose**: Combine scorecard-driven and similarity-based themes for comprehensive insights

**Key Functions**:
1. **Convergence Detection**
   - Identify themes that converge between approaches
   - Calculate convergence scores based on semantic similarity and criteria overlap
   - Determine convergence types (criteria_aligned, semantic_convergence, weak_convergence)

2. **Hybrid Synthesis Creation**
   - Generate hybrid insights from converging themes
   - Create standalone syntheses for non-converging themes
   - Ensure synthesis quality and executive readiness

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Synthesis quality score
   - Evidence convergence score
   - Stakeholder alignment score

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "synthesis_title": "Proactive Support Gap Creates Competitive Opportunity",
  "synthesis_type": "hybrid",
  "executive_insight": "Both scorecard and similarity analysis reveal...",
  "strategic_implications": "This insight suggests...",
  "action_recommendations": "Immediate actions include...",
  "synthesis_quality_score": 0.82
}
```
