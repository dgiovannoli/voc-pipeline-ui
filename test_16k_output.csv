Luminos Law_Christina Fouche_1_1,"So my name is Christina Fouch√©. I'm the director of operations for a law firm that handles AI compliance. This one, we are looking at 7 to 8 attorneys and four support staff, but we just recently got bought out by a mid-size firm, so we are going to be absorbed into a medium sized firm that has 80 attorneys and I think it was 35 support staff. That is slowly already kind of taking place. They bought us out. As of, we signed the contract at the end of December 31st, and now we are absorbed to that new firm. So when that new firm, I am the operations manager for the AI division. And now we're just completely absorbed. So when I use Rev, it was for our AI and managing different meetings, just trying to get different testimonies of how they've been using the program and what they are looking for. A lot of people were sending different meetings. It was before really when Zoom and teams meetings were actually transcribing and transcribing the meetings, we were using Rev a lot for those type. So now with more companies doing it, we haven't had to use Rev as much.",Company Transition and Reduced Rev Usage,Introduction and Firm Size,closed_won,Luminos Law,Christina Fouche,2024-01-01
Luminos Law_Christina Fouche_1_2,"That very few in between. And I'm trying to remember when did we use it for the legal ones. When we had pretty much recordings or audios in conference room, like in person type one, we would tell them we would record it. Those recordings I used to send in to Rev when I wanted to transcribe it, just so we can have a record. So if someone wanted to reference something, they didn't have to listen to the two hour meeting, they can go into the highlights of Rev transcription to find and listen to it. That was really helpful when we were doing in person that I would use you guys, because I've used you guys in the last 3 or 4 firms that we've used. In the mass tort when I used to work for this company, I told them that a lot of the calls that we would get would be recorded, and that they should try using your service to just have it transcribed. So we just had a transcript of the call in the file, just for better reference and for auditing.",Legal Recordings and Transcriptions,Legal Use Cases for Rev Transcriptions,closed_won,Luminos Law,Christina Fouche,2024-01-01
Luminos Law_Christina Fouche_1_3,"In the legal world when you have mass torts and you have so many people, so many claimants and you have to call each one, go through the questions to see what they qualified. Those type of transcripts are a lot easier than going back to the calls. And if you're familiar with, like the Johnson and Johnson Talcum Powder Mass tort, or if you've seen, like the Camp Lejeune commercials, you can have a thousand plus potential claimants that you have to have calls that you're just calling them. But we have the audio, but we don't have the transcripts. And then when you go through all their documents and it comes, the other side would pick out a few potential claimants that they want to do further depositions on. You want to go back to those calls again. You don't want to listen to it. So going when it qualifies to the second round using your service was a very big help in just having that file and preparing the attorneys so they don't have to listen to the call. They can just read what the call had, and if they had any questions, they were ready for depositions. So if you really want to know the space now that would be probably give you the best client base. I would look into the mass tort space.",Mass Tort Litigation and Transcription Benefits,Benefits of Rev Transcriptions in Mass Tort Cases,closed_won,Luminos Law,Christina Fouche,2024-01-01
